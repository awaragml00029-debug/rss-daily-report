**1.** ⭐ **GSE316782 多模态单细胞和空间分析揭示侵袭性非小细胞肺癌患者非转移性淋巴结中 T 细胞介导的免疫和 B 细胞滤泡结构的改变**

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Zhan Hao Xi ; Yusuke Koga ; Sarah A Mazzilli ; Kei Suzuki ; Joshua D CampbellSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing ; OtherOrganism : Homo sapiensRegional lymph nodes (LNs) in the thoracic cavity serve as essential immunological hubs that coordinate humoral and cell-mediated responses against the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To investigate immune dysregulation in the non-metastatic regional LNs of patients with aggressive NSCLC, we performed multimodal profiling on 36 LNs from 11 patients undergoing curative-intent resection including CITE-seq, scRNA-seq, and Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC). Regional N1 LNs from patients with more aggressive disease (stage IB–IIIA) exhibited a significant enrichment of dysfunctional CD8⁺ T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) compared to N2 LNs and LNs from patients with less aggressive disease (stage IA). These immune subsets were spatially co-localized with mature regulatory dendritic cells (mregDCs; CD1c⁺, TIM3⁺, LAMP3⁺), forming an immunosuppressive niche uniquely enriched in the N1 LNs of higher-stage patients. Concurrently, higher-stage N1 LNs contained larger number of “decorticated” B-cell follicles characterized by decreased encapsulation of the mantle zone layer surrounding the germinal centers. This mantle zone disorganization was associated with increased spatial niches involving Tregs, CD68⁺ CD163⁺ TIM3⁺ Macrophages, CD163⁺ TIM3dim Monocytic-Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (M-MDSC), plasma B cells, and a decrease in spatial niches involving CD4⁺ T helper cells and fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs). Together, our findings reveal parallel alterations in humoral and cell-mediated immunity within the regional LNs of patients with aggressive NSCLC.

**2.** ⭐ **GSE316608 通过原位多聚腺苷酸化和空间 RNA 测序对微生物组-宿主相互作用进行高分辨率空间映射 [空间转录组学]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：sequencing、spatial、spatial transcriptomics、transcriptomics
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Ioannis Ntekas ; David W McKellar ; Lena Takayasu ; Iwijn De VlaminckSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Mus musculusInter-microbial and host-microbial interactions are critical for the functioning of the gut microbiome, but few tools are available to measure these interactions in situ. Here, we report a method for broad spatial sampling of microbiome-host interactions in the gut at high resolution (1 µm). This method combines enzymatic in situ polyadenylation of both bacterial and host RNA with spatial RNA-sequencing to increase bacterial RNA recovery and enable transcriptomic analysis of low-abundance and spatially restricted microbial taxa. We benchmark the method against existing spatial transcriptomic workflows, demonstrating improved sensitivity and resolution. Application of this method in a mouse model of intestinal neoplasia revealed the biogeography of the mouse gut microbiome as function of location in the intestine, frequent strong inter-microbial interactions at short length scales, and tumor-associated changes in the architecture of the host-microbiome interface. This method is compatible with widely available commercial platforms for spatial RNA-sequencing and can therefore be readily adopted to study the role of short-range, bidirectional host-microbe interactions in microbiome health and disease.

**3.** ⭐ **GSE294120 类维生素A对紫外线诱导的皮肤光老化的影响研究[空间转录组学]**

While retinoids such as retinol and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) promote extracellular matrix (ECM) regeneration, their side effects limit widespread use. We propose that hydroxypinacolone 9-cis retinoate (9-cis HPR), a derivative of 9-cis retinoic acid, activates both retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR), enhancing efficacy while minimizing irritation. However, its in vivo anti-photoaging effects remain underexplored. This study evaluates 9-cis HPR in the UVR-damaged SKH-1 mouse model, investigating its role in inflammation control, ECM regeneration, and melanogenesis suppression.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Katharina Weishaupt ; David Chambers ; Maria Dzamukova ; Ivana Androšević ; Jean-Philippe Auger ; Darleen Hüser ; Sébastien Trzebanski ; Andreas Ramming ; Anika Grüneboom ; Georg Schett ; Steffen Jung ; Markus H Hoffmann ; Gerhard KrönkeSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusThe molecular details of macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk during the onset and resolution of inflammatory disease remain incompletely understood. Here, we apply a scRNAseq-, scATACseq- and bulk RNAseq-based bioinformatic modelling approach to map heterocellular signaling circuits of synovial macrophage and synovial fibroblast (SF) subsets during various stages of inflammatory arthritis. While SFs function as key pacemakers of synovial inflammation, individual subsets of synovial macrophages support both the perpetuation and the resolution of arthritis. While pro-inflammatory Il1b+ macrophages dominate the early stages of inflammation, these cells also retain a substantial intrinsic plasticity that is characterized by chromatin remodeling and an eventual differentiation into Spp1+ macrophages. These cells display a terminally-differentiated phenotype, suppresses activation of pro-inflammatory SFs, and initiates the resolution of arthritis by secretion of regulatory mediators including osteopontin. Our data highlight the dichotomous character of macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk and define the cellular and molecular checkpoints that control the onset and resolution of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：carcinoma、immune、resistance
- 📝 **描述**：Contributor : Junhui SuSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusClear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) despite its high tumor mutational burden, highlighting an urgent need to elucidate tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of immune escape. Here, leveraging lineage tracing and single-cell multi-omic profiling in immunocompetent models, we identify a pre-existing SLC6A3-positive tumor subpopulation that persists following anti-PD-1 therapy and orchestrates immune evasion by exploiting renal dopamine uptake. SLC6A3 overexpression is robustly associated with diminished infiltration of cytotoxic CD8⁺ T cells and myeloid dendritic cells, establishing it as a biomarker of ICI resistance in ccRCC. Mechanistically, SLC6A3-mediated dopamine import disrupts the MHC-I antigen presentation pathway through direct sequestration of the spliceosomal regulator USP39, resulting in aberrant splicing of B2m and Tap1/2 pre-mRNAs and consequent loss of antigenicity. This disconnects high mutational burden from effective immune surveillance, enabling sustained immune escape. Critically, both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of SLC6A3 restore antigen presentation competency, potentiate CD8⁺ T cell cytotoxicity, and synergize with anti-PD-1 treatment to achieve durable tumor regression in vivo. Our findings redefine dopamine as a tumor-intrinsic immunosuppressant in ccRCC and nominate the SLC6A3-USP39 axis as a tractable target for reversing antigen presentation defects and overcoming microenvironment-driven ICI resistance.

We found that expression of the gerozyme 15-Prostaglandin Dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) was increased in the articular cartilage of aged or injured mice. Both systemic and local inhibition of 15-PGDH with a small molecule inhibitor (PGDHi) led to regeneration of articular cartilage and reduction in OA-associated pain. We used single cell RNA-sequencing and multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging of cartilage), to identify the major chondrocyte subpopulationsInhibition of 15-PGDH decreased hypertrophic-like chondrocytes expressing 15-PGDH and fibro-chondrocytes towards hyaline matrix-synthesizing articular chondrocytes. Regeneration of joint cartilage appears to occur through changes in pre-existing chondrocytes, not stem or progenitor cell proliferation.Gerozyme inhibition could be a potential identifying a disease-modifying and regenerative approach with potential utility for the treatment of osteoarthritis.
