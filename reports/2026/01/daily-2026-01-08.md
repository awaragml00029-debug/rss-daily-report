- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、metabolic、trajectory
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Hao Ying ; Ling Zhang ; Siyi Shen ; Jing YuSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusA better understanding of functional heterogeneity of tumor cells may lead to the improvement of the diagnosis and development of effective therapies for patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Here, the transcriptional heterogeneity and hierarchical trajectory of malignant thyrocytes were investigated by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis in an adult-onset autochthonous mouse model of PTC driven by a BRAFV600E. Within BRAFV600E thyrocytes, we identified distinct subpopulations exhibiting varying degrees of mesenchymal transformation and stability. Further analysis uncovered an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) trajectory, where malignant subpopulations progress from an intermediate to a more mesenchymal and malignant state. The EMT-related phenotype of each subpopulation was validated with an organoid culture system. Further analysis demonstrated that major malignant subpopulations maintain distinct EMT states through subpopulation-specific pathway usage, whereas transitioning cells undergo a dynamic shift in molecular strategy by using different pathway combinations or distinct gene sets within the same EMT-related pathways along the EMT trajectory. Moreover, metformin diminished the most malignant subpopulation in the PTC mouse model and inhibited EMT potential in both regular and organoid cultures. Importantly, the functional heterogeneity of tumor cells identified in PTC mouse model have clinical relevance. Furthermore, transcriptome dynamics analysis revealed an EMT trajectory-related gene module with substantial predictive value for human PTCs with BRAFV600E. Lastly, our analysis reveals that p53 deficiency lowers the tumorigenic threshold for BRAFV600E and promotes cell state transition towards a more malignant state, rather than altering cellular heterogeneity or the transition trajectory. Subsequent analysis in vitro demonstrated that p53 loss might confer more malignant potential to BRAFV600E thyrocytes through modulating metabolic plasticity. Collectively, our work not only deciphers the functional intra-tumoral heterogeneity of BRAFV600E-drieven PTC but also thereby provides a theoretical foundation for developing EMT-targeted treatment.

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、RNA-seq、histone
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Ola Hassan ; Mattia Pizzagalli ; Owen Leary ; John Zepecki ; Laura Jinxuan Wu ; Daniel Lee ; Lindsey R Howard ; Jorge E Fajardo ; Andras Fiser ; David Karambizi ; Nikos TapinosSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensClass IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a family of enzymes that despite their name, do not have any measurable histone deacetylase activity but they function as multi-protein interaction hubs due to the presence of a prolonged N-terminal domain. Here we show that HDAC7, a member of the Class IIa HDAC family, is a chaperone for Histone H3.3 and, interacts with H3.3 and HIRA on chromatin. Specific inhibition of HDAC7 expression with subtype specific siRNAs results in inhibition of the interaction of H3.3 with HIRA, while the association of H3.3 with DAXX and H3K9me3 is significantly increased, resulting in H3.3 being deposited on H3K9me3+/DAPI+ heterochromatin nuclear foci with observed changes in RNA expression. This drives substantial alteration of cancer cell gene expression as well as inhibition of the stemness phenotype for cancer cells. To understand the genome wide effect on expression, we perform RNA-seq following HDAC7 knockdown.

Inhibition of HDAC7 triggers a significant increase of heterochromatin marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, global heterochromatin spreading in cancer cells, and reprogramming of the H3.3 chromatin landscape. We performed H3K9me3 chip-seq in glioma stem cells following HDAC7 knockdown in order to identify specific sites of heterochromatin spreading and/or increased occupancy.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributor : Kohsuke ShirakawaSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusThis study aimed to characterize the transcriptomic landscape of Spp1-expressing interstitial macrophages (IMs) in the lungs of a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We utilized Spp1-EGFP knock-in reporter mice, in which EGFP marks Spp1-expressing cells. Pulmonary fibrosis was induced by intratracheal administration of bleomycin. Lung cells were isolated, and Spp1-EGFP⁺ SiglecF⁻ CD11b⁺ interstitial macrophages were enriched by flow cytometric sorting. Approximately 10,000 viable sorted cells were processed for single-cell transcriptome profiling using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v3.1 (10x Genomics), and libraries were sequenced on a DNBSEQ-G400 platform. This dataset provides a high-resolution view of the cellular states and gene expression profiles of interstitial macrophages during lung fibrosis.

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：immune、inflammation
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : YunJae Jung ; Minji Park ; Jin-Ok BaekSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusAtopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by T helper 2 cell dysregulation and accumulation of innate immune cells. While recent studies have highlighted a role for neutrophils in the onset and progression of AD, their precise contributions remain incompletely defined. In a mouse model of AD-like inflammation induced by calcipotriol and ovalbumin, neutrophils were identified as a major source of the cytokine oncostatin M (OSM). Neutrophil-derived OSM promoted broad immune cell recruitment, exacerbated skin inflammation, and enhanced the expression of neuronal markers associated with pruritus. Knockdown of OSM and neutrophil depletion both attenuated inflammatory responses and neuronal activation. Publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets further confirmed increased OSM expression in neutrophils from lesional AD skin, underscoring the translational relevance of our findings. These results reveal a previously unrecognized intercellular communication axis in which neutrophil-derived OSM orchestrates multifaceted immune and neuroinflammatory responses in AD. Targeting this signaling pathway may offer a novel therapeutic avenue for AD and related inflammatory disorders.

**9.** **GSE238259 Akr1b7 在卵巢衰老中起着关键调控作用 [RNA-seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：aging、RNA-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Keishiro Isayama ; Kenji Watanabe ; Masato Ohtsuka ; Seisuke Kimura ; Tomoaki Murata ; Takeshi Honda ; Masataka Asagiri ; Shun Sato ; Hiroshi Tamura ; Norihiro Sugino ; Yoichi MizukamiSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusAt the beginning of ovarian aging, the ovulation of immature oocytes is accelerated, finally leading to the arrest of ovulation despite the remaining oocytes. Here RNA expression in ovarian aging of mice is comprehensively analyzed during the estrous cycle after ovulation stimulation, and an aldo-keto reductase Akr1b7 pathway transiently increased in the young ovary is eliminated in the aged mice. Akr1b7-/- mice enhance the ovulation of immature oocytes, and the KITL expression in Akr1b7-expressed stromal is attenuated, accompanied by oocyte Akt essential for the follicular development inactivation in primordial follicles. The estrous cycle is extended due to the prolonged diestrous stage by a sustained progesterone level in Akr1b7-/- mice ovaries, which is caused by the decline of Cyp17a1, a major metabolite enzyme of progesterone in Akr1b7-expressed theca cell layers. Taken together, the decreased Akr1b7 pathway causes the ovulation of immature oocytes and the prolonged estrous cycle, typical symptoms of ovarian aging.

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：methylation、histone
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Johnathan Whetstine ; Kashish Chetal ; Ruslan SadreyevSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensAcquired chromosomal DNA copy gains are a feature of many tumors; however, the mechanisms that underpin oncogene amplifi cation are poorly understood. Recent studies have begun to uncover the importance of epigenetic states and histone lysine methyltrans_x0002_ferases (KMT) and demethylases (KDM) in regulating transient site-specifi c DNA copy-number gains (TSSG). In this study, we reveal a critical interplay between a myriad of lysine methyltransferases and demethylases in modulating H3K4/9/27 methylation balance to control extrachromosomal amplifi ca_x0002_tion of the EGFR oncogene. This study further establishes that cellular signals (hypoxia and EGF) are able to directly promote EGFR amplifi cation through modulation of the enzymes controlling EGFR copy gains. Moreover, we demonstrate that chemical inhibitors targeting specifi c KMTs and KDMs are able to promote or block extrachromosomal EGFR amplifi cation, which identifi es potential therapeu
