**1.** ⭐ **GSE316477 肿瘤细胞聚集通过调控H3K36组蛋白去甲基化酶KDM2A增强转移能力**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、histone、clustering
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Carolyn Kravitz ; Kiran D Patel ; Emily Wingrove ; Dejian Zhao ; Tang Tang ; Sampada Chande ; Yuchen Huo ; Thomas F Westbrook ; Qin Yan ; Don X NguyenSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensDisseminated tumor cells can form clusters via cell-cell adhesion, which increases their capacity to initiate metastasis. Metastatic clusters are characterized by distinct changes in transcription, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms underlie their unique phenotypic state. By performingfunctional epigenomic studies in models of non-small-cell lung cancer, we identified the histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) demethylase KDM2A as being differentially required for the fitness of metastatic cell clusters. This contextual dependency on KDM2A is predicated by tumor cell-cell aggregation, which specifically induces KDM2A binding to CpG island enriched promoters. At these defined genomic loci, KDM2A maintains H3K36 monomethylation, which preferentially correlates with transcriptional activation. KDM2A directly targets oxidative phosphorylation genes and KDM2A activity is required for optimal mitochondrial respiration and apical cell junction integrity in cell clusters. Consequently, suppressing KDM2A reduces metastatic seeding and colonization in multiple organs, including in the brain. These findings reveal a chromatin regulatory mechanism by which homotypic cell communication instructs the epigenome of disseminated tumor cells to potentiate their metastatic competence.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Josane F Sousa ; Gabriela Lima ; Louise Perez ; Hannah Schof ; Igor SchneiderSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Ambystoma mexicanumComparative studies of vertebrate appendages offer a powerful framework for uncovering shared components of an ancestral regeneration toolkit. Here, we employed a multi-omics comparative approach leveraging the regenerative capacity of the axolotl, zebrafish, and Polypterus senegalus, a fish capable of full fin regeneration. We identified conserved markers of proximal and distal blastema territories, shared activation of DNA damage repair, hif1a-mediated hypoxia response, and sequential activation of pro- and anti-inflammatory program. Apical epithelial ridge markers were expressed in both the wound epidermis and distal mesenchyme during limb and fin regeneration. Notably, hif4a-expressing erythrocytes were uniquely associated with proximal limb and fin amputations but not fin rays, while epidermal myoglobin expression was upregulated only in Polypterus and zebrafish fins. Genome-wide chromatin profiling identified candidate regeneration-responsive elements and a conserved enrichment for AP-1 transcription factor binding. Together, these finding identify shared and derived mechanisms of limb and fin regeneration.

Here, we used in vivo genome-wide genetic perturbations in primary wildtype (WT) or Tet2 knockout (KO) Cas9+ hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs) in a model of zymosan peritonitis to elucidate the basis of Tet2 KO inflammation. We found that Tet2 restrains O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) glycosyltransferase (Ogt), a Tet2 binding partner and metabolic sensor that integrates nutrient availability. Tet2 loss disrupts this Tet2-Ogt interaction, and dysregulated Ogt facilitates widespread H3K4 trimethylation including lipid-related gene loci and inflammatory lipid droplet formation. We identified ATP citrate lyase (Acly) as a critical node for lipid accumulation, inflammation, and myeloid expansion in Tet2 deficiency. In summary, we reveal that Tet2 serves as a negative regulator of the nutrient sensor Ogt, and that Tet2 inactivation leads to aberrant lipid droplet formation and inflammation.

**6.** **GSE296587 对共存染色质特征的DNA甲基化和羟甲基化进行测序**

However, current methods cannot simultaneously resolve the presence of multiple DNA modifications at co-occurring chromatin-associated features. It is thus not clear how these features are physically coupled and how their combinations regulate genome function. To address this key question, we report 6-base-CUT&Tag, a method for simultaneous 6-base sequencing at target chromatin features. Using 6-base-CUT&Tag to profile 5mC and 5hmC at co-occurring histone modifications in mouse embryonic stem cells, we identify histone mark-specific signatures of methylation and hydroxymethylation to improve discrimination of different functional enhancer states.

**7.** **GSE312873 巨噬细胞组织驻留所需的多胺介导的翻译后修饰 [scRNA-seq 2]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：macrophage、scRNA
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Erika L Pearce ; David E Sanin ; Gustavo CarrizoSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusTissue-resident macrophages (RTMs) form during embryogenesis, self-renew locally, and regulate tissue homeostasis by clearing dead cells and debris. During tissue damage, however, bone marrow-derived monocytes enter tissue sites and differentiate into RTM, repairing the tissue and replenishing macrophages in the niche. Universal cell-intrinsic mechanisms that control the monocyte to RTM transition remain elusive. We investigated mice with myeloid cell deletions in deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS), an enzyme that mediates the polyamine-dependent hypusine modification of the translation factor eIF5A, and found that DHPS is required for cell adhesion and signaling programs critical for RTMs. Without DHPS expression, immature tissue macrophages form, but RTM and associated homeostatic functions are lost. Thus, the polyamine-hypusine pathway is a global, tissue-agnostic program driving the differentiation trajectory of monocyte-derived macrophages into RTM.

**10.** **GSE283746 婴儿单细胞比较分析揭示了 RSV 特异性 NK 细胞反应下降和 COVID-19 特异性炎症反应增加 [COVID_RSV_scRNA]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：NK cell、single-cell
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Asa Thibodeau ; Asunción Mejías ; Djamel Nehar-Belaid ; Radu Marches ; Virginia Pascual ; Jacques Banchereau ; Octavio Ramilo ; Duygu UcarSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensThe clinical phenotype of infants infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) differs from that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infection and carries a significant higher risk of respiratory failure compared to SARS-CoV-2, which has been generally linked to fever and croup in young infants. The underlying mechanisms these differences remain unclear. We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum from infants infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=30), RSV (n=19), and healthy controls (n=17) using single-cell RNA sequencing, single-nucleus ATAC sequencing and cytokine profiling. Both viruses triggered type I interferon responses across PBMC subsets but differed in their NK cell and inflammatory responses. Severe RSV cases were characterized by lower NK cell percentages, lower IFNG expression and diminished chromatin accessibility at T-BET and EOMES binding sites in NK cells. Furthermore, RSV infections were associated with increased frequencies of CD4+ TEMRA and memory Treg cells. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infections were marked by more pronounced pro-inflammatory signatures, including increased transcriptional and epigenetic activity at NFKB factors and higher serum TNF concentrations. These findings highlight distinct immune response pathways in RSV and SARS-CoV-2 infections that may inform future therapeutic strategies.

- 📝 **描述**：A large international study reveals that mammals tend to live longer when reproduction is suppressed. On average, lifespan increases by about 10 percent, though the reasons differ for males and females. Castrated males avoid the harmful effects of testosterone, while females gain longevity by sidestepping the intense physical demands of pregnancy and nursing. The results underscore a powerful biological trade-off between making offspring and staying alive longer.
