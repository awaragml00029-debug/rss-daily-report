- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cardiac、sequencing、RNA-seq、transcriptome
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Veronica Larcher ; Nuno Guimaraes-Camboa ; Paola Cattaneo ; Lukas TomborSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensGdf10 encodes growth and differentiation factor 10, a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) superfamily. Cardiac fibroblasts are known to express high levels of these receptors (used to transduce TGFβ signaling, a central pathway in fibroblast activation). In this study, we showed that adventitial fibroblasts express Gdf10 at higher levels than interstitial fibroblasts at both neonatal level and in adulthood, suggesting that it might represent a cell autonomous signaling mechanism. To test this, we conducted RNA-seq experiment in primary human cardiac fibroblasts subjected to recombinant GDF10. Whole transcriptome analysis revealed minimal alterations (only 4 moderately modulated genes), suggesting that rather than a cell autonomous mechanism, Gdf10 expression in adventitial CFs represents a mechanism for crosstalk with a distinct cardiac cell type.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Veronica Larcher ; Nuno Guimaraes-Camboa ; Paola Cattaneo ; Omar AlmollaSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusIn this study, we investigated the role of LepR-Cre+ cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Our results reveal a specific gene expression profile of LepR-Cre+ CFs cells compared with LepR-Cre- CFs in both the postnatal period (P7) and adulthood (P56). Our findings support a model in which adventitial fibroblasts, being characterized by upregulation of genes involved in critical functions, including hedgehog signaling, blood pressure regulation, and interaction with the immune system, are major contributors in cardiac fibrosis.

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、inflammation
- 📝 **描述**：Contributor : Rossukon KaewkhawSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensBackground: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype with limited treatment options, characterized by high relapse rates and poor survival outcomes due to chemoresistance. This study aimed to repurpose FDA-approved drugs for TNBC and investigate their mechanisms of action in inhibiting cancer cells and counteracting chemoresistance. Methods: Patient-derived TNBC organoids were generated from residual tumors of patients with disease progression despite receiving standard-of-care chemotherapy. A high throughput screen of 133 FDA-approved anticancer drugs was performed on the organoids to identify potent cytotoxic agents using image-based analysis and drug-sensitivity assays. Drug response dynamics were analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of these agents in counteracting clinical drug resistance. The molecular and functional effects of the identified agents were investigated through proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, as well as translation and cell cycle assays. Results: Proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (BTZ) and carfilzomib (CFZ) were identified as potent candidates for inhibiting TNBC organoids. These drugs significantly downregulated ribosomal protein expression, suppressing translation and disrupting cell cycle progression. While TNBC organoids exhibited resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics, they were susceptible to proteasome inhibitors. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that proteasome inhibitors counteracted inflammation-driven resistance to doxorubicin (DXR) by exerting dual anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects. Conclusions: This study identifies proteasome inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC, offering a novel approach to address unmet clinical needs. Using patient-derived organoids, this work highlights inflammation as a driver of DXR resistance and establishes it as a therapeutic target effectively counteracted by proteasome inhibitors.

**6.** **GSE287386 局部区域自体PD-1敲除T细胞治疗一线治疗失败的晚期肝细胞癌患者**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：carcinoma、T cell
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Wei Wang ; Qi Liang ; Xiaoqian MaSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensThe study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel cell-based therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Current guidelines for advanced HCC recommend systemic therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs); however, their combined efficacy as first-line treatments remains suboptimal. This study reports findings from a first-in-human phase I clinical trial involving 3 patients with advanced HCC who had previously demonstrated poor responses to first-line therapies. The treatment involved local intratumoral injection of CRISPR-edited, PD1-deleted T lymphocytes, engineered to enhance antitumor immunity (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04417764). Key outcomes include a treatment response rate of 90% among assessable patients, with a median survival after enrolment of 17.2 months and an overall median survival after HCC diagnosis of 46.9 months. As of December 31, 2023, the three-year survival rate was 20%, and one patient exhibited an exceptional survival duration of 43.6 months. Secondary outcomes revealed that patients receiving the engineered T-cell therapy reported a significantly improved quality of life compared to the observation group. The tumor immune microenvironment was analyzed pre- and post-therapy using single-cell RNA sequencing, which demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) developed an effector-like phenotype following therapy. In conclusion, this study provides strong evidence supporting the viability of CRISPR-edited, PD1-deleted T lymphocytes as a therapeutic option for advanced HCC, addressing an urgent need for more effective treatment strategies in this patient population.

**7.** **GSE316836 批量 RNA 测序检测到髋关节置换患者 cMPC HO 特征**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：RNA-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Matilda Holtz ; Sneha Korlakunta ; Johanna Nunez ; Hanil Kang ; Benjamin Levi ; Murat Karabacak ; Florence LinSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensHeterotopic ossification (HO), the aberrant bone in soft tissues, is one of the most debilitating complications associated with severe burn and traumatic injuries as well as joint replacement surgeries due to its insidious development. Currently, no technologies exist to either support early HO detection or to guide early prophylactic strategies. Furthermore, no technologies exist to assess treatment efficacy. In this study, we used microfluidic iChip, designed to isolate circulating rare non-hematopoietic cells from whole blood, to isolate and analyze circulating mesenchymal progenitor cells (cMPCs) released in patients that underwent hip artroplasty. RNA sequencing of cMPCs revealed the unique expression of HO-associated MPC genes observed post operation day 1, weeks earlier than gold standard radiographic diagnostic strategies.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Houjian Zhang ; Yuli Guo ; Wenxin Sun ; Wei Zha ; Xuechun Wang ; Zuguo LiuSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusIrreversible loss of retinal neurons is the leading cause of blindness. Harnessing the latent stem cell potential of mammalian Müller glia offers a promising strategy for endogenous retinal regeneration. Shifting the Müller glia response from gliosis to regeneration after retinal injury is a critical step in promoting the orderly entry of Müller glia into a regenerative program. However, the molecular switch governing this divergent fate decision remains elusive. Here, through RNA-seq and scRNA-seq, we confirm the upstream determinant of Müller glia fate after retinal injury.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Sneha Korlakunta ; Johanna Nunez ; Hanil Kang ; Chase Pagani ; Benjamin Levi ; Murat KarabacakSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusHeterotopic ossification (HO), the aberrant bone in soft tissues, is one of the most debilitating complications associated with severe burn and traumatic injuries as well as joint replacement surgeries due to its insidious development. Currently, no technologies exist to either support early HO detection or to guide early prophylactic strategies. Furthermore, no technologies exist to assess treatment efficacy. In this study, we used microfluidic iChip, designed to isolate circulating rare non-hematopoietic cells from whole blood, to isolate and analyze circulating mesenchymal progenitor cells (cMPCs) released in a clinically relevant mouse model of traumatic HO. RNA sequencing of cMPCs revealed the unique expression of HO-associated MPC genes observed as soon as 6 hours post HO-inducing injury, 41 days earlier than gold standard radiographic diagnostic strategies. Using multiple lineage tracing systems, we determined that the cMPCs derived from the periosteum rather than the bone marrow. We then formulated a cMPC HO score and evaluated the diagnostic ability of the liquid biopsy approach for the early detection of HO. By using Youden’s J Statistic for optimizing sensitivity and specificity, our score yielded a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 100% for detecting HO in mice.
