The pathological hallmarks of AD, beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), follow distinct stereotypical patterns of progression across brain regions and trigger a multicellular response that ultimately leads to neuronal loss and cognitive decline. Despite the uniform spread of Aβ plaque across the cortex during AD progression, different regions demonstrate varying levels of vulnerability and resilience to temporal Aβ plaque induced changes, such as NFT accumulation. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the cell types and molecular mechanisms that underlie these region-specific differences in resilience to Aβ plaque induced changes. In this study, we hypothesized that brain region and cell type specific transcriptional responses within the Aβ microenvironment, and more broadly within the grey matter, may contribute to this variation. We carried out matched multi-region spatial transcriptomics and Aβ immunofluorescence staining from the entorhinal, occipito-temporal, dorsolateral prefrontal and striate cortices from two individuals with Braak III and Thal 4 AD. Spatiotemporal comparisons of cell type proportions, gene expression, and cell-cell communication revealed differences in the vulnerability of somatostatin and somatostatin chondrolectin inhibitory neurons and the expression of endosomal and lysosomal trafficking and metallothionein genes within the Aβ plaque microenvironment. We also observed variations in blood-brain-barrier dysfunction, fibroblast growth factor signaling, and vascular impairment and repair related cell-cell communication networks within the grey matter. Our results demonstrate the value of simultaneously profiling AD-omic and spatial modalities in multiple regions to elucidate how cortical region-specific differences contribute to selective vulnerability and resilience during neurodegeneration.

However, our understanding of the flight organs involved remains limited. The silkworm Bombyx mori, a lepidopteran model insect, loses flight most recently, while the Bombyx mandarina capable of flight, therefore it is a good model for studying flight loss. Here, we represent the first description of the spatiotemporal architecture of Bombyx flight organs. We demonstrated that the weakened cellular function of NFDCs and FECs determining the flight energy and wing vein and flight muscle development largely result in flight loss in B. mori, and single-cell analyses of cotton bollworm flight organs and RNA interference (RNAi) of key genes validated these findings, and the cellular and molecular determinants of flight may be conserved across Lepidoptera. These findings will contribute to the understanding of flight loss encountered in flying species.

Our previous studies demonstrated that YAP1/TEAD are highly expressed in GEAC, and play a critical role in tumor progression, therapy resistance and metastasis. Thus, targeting YAP/TEAD signaling presents a promising therapeutic strategy. Here, we developed a novel YAP/TEAD inhibitor VT00278 based on the structure of CA3 and showed that VT00278 strongly downregulated YAP/TEAD transcriptional activity, and potently suppress tumor-promoting phenotypes, including proliferation, invasion, tumor sphere formation; induce apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth in vivo especially in radiation resistant FLO-1 XTR GEAC cells. Mechanistically, in addition to impairing YAP1/TEAD signaling, VT00278 or YAP1 depletion repressed RNA polymerase II transcriptional regulators, reduced RNAPII S2 phosphorylation and decreased anti-apoptosis MCL-1 expression. More interestingly, we revealed that VT00278 strongly induced DNA damage, activated cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, upregulation of innate immune genes (e.g.INFβ) and increased PDL-1 expression. In a syngeneic mouse model, combining VT00278 with anti-PD-1 therapy synergistically inhibited tumor growth and increased CD3+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration and induced the production of INFγ from CD3 and CD8 cells in the combination treatment. These findings support VT00278 as a promising candidate for GEAC treatment, either alone or in combination with immunotherapy.

**9.** ⭐ **GSE274639 MYOD1L122R 诱导癌症干细胞通路，使侵袭性横纹肌肉瘤产生化疗和放射抗性 [scATAC-seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、resistance、scATAC
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Yun Wei ; Luis A Sanchez ; Shuze Wang ; Esther Rheinbay ; David M LangenauSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensRhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma of skeletal muscle. Worse outcomes are associated with specific subtypes of RMS, including the 10% of fusion-negative tumors that harbor point mutations in the DNA binding domain of MYOD1 (myogenic differentiation 1) transcription factor. Due to the rarity of these patient samples and dearth of cell lines/animal models, the molecular function of MYOD1L122R remains unknown. Here, we create the first animal model of this disease showing that MYOD1L122R is not oncogenic but collaborates with RAS activation to create highly aggressive RMS in transgenic zebrafish, akin to what is reported in human disease. Limiting dilution cell transplantation revealed that MYOD1L122R also elevated the overall frequency of tumor propagating cells in the zebrafish model. We next generated isogenic knock-in MYOD1L122R human cell line models and showed that these cells were refractory to standard of care vincristine, actinomycin, and cyclophosphamide while also elevating the overall frequency of tumor propagating cells. Indeed, single-cell RNA transcriptional profiling and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-Seq) of patient and patient-derived xenografts confirmed the elevation of cancer stem cell programs within MYOD1L122R tumors. Using unbiased whole-genome ChIP and RNA sequencing, we next identified the shared and differential genomic binding regions by MYOD1L122R as compared to wildtype MYOD1. Most notably, MYOD1L122R bound uniquely to and transcriptionally upregulated mesenchymal pathway enriched genes that are known to correlate with RMS cancer stemness. Finally, mechanistic studies uncovered that MYOD1L122R binds to the regulatory element of ROR2 (receptor tyrosine kinase like orphan receptor 2), upregulating its expression, which then turns on a novel WNT11-ROR2-VANGL2 axis to induce non-canonical WNT signaling and elevate cancer stemness.
