- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、carcinoma、immune
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Amin Reza Nikpoor ; Maryam Ahmadi ; Sebastien Talbot ; Nicole ScheffSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusPeripheral sensory nerves are thought to contribute to solid tumor growth, particularly in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC); however, the link between pain and immunosuppression remains unresolved. Here, using a prospective observational study, we demonstrate an inverse relationship between OSCC-induced pain mediated by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-expressing nerves and tumor-associated immunity. Bulk RNA sequencing of tumor-innervating sensory neurons from mice revealed differential regulation of genes associated with excitability, neurotransmission, and axonal sprouting. Using a gain-of-function approach with persistent stimulation of peptidergic afferents, we show that sensory neurons promote oral tongue tumor growth and limit the activation of effective anti-tumor immune responses via efferent CGRP release. Conversely, loss-of-function approaches—including local ablation of nociceptive nerves and systemic CGRP receptor antagonism—slowed tumor growth and improved anti-tumor immunity. Targeting CGRP may therefore represent a therapeutic strategy in OSCC to reduce pain and improve treatment response.

**5.** **GSE311919 代谢重编程调控斑马鱼尾鳍再生过程中的组蛋白乳酸化**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：metabolic、histone
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Jorge Borbinha ; Raquel Lourenço ; Ana S Brandão ; Daniel Ribeiro ; Ana Carvalho ; Rune Matthiesen ; António JacintoSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Danio rerioTissue regeneration relies on precise molecular mechanisms controlling cell fate transitions, with cell metabolism emerging as a key regulator. Lactate-derived histone lactylation has recently been identified as an important epigenetic modification involved in the regulation of gene expression across various biological processes. In this study, we report an increase in global histone lactylation and H3K18Lac levels in the mesenchyme and osteoblasts of the zebrafish caudal fin, during the early stages of regeneration. Our findings demonstrate that this epigenetic modification is functionally regulated by increased lactate levels, while inhibition of glycolysis and lactate production significantly reduces histone lactylation. These results suggest that metabolic reprogramming, in response to caudal fin injury, regulates histone lactylation, potentially modulating gene expression essential for cell plasticity and proliferation. This study expands our understanding of how metabolic-epigenetic interactions influence regenerative processes, providing valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to enhance tissue repair.

**7.** **GSE310170 胚胎干细胞因子 DPPA2/4 扩增非小细胞肺癌中的活性 H3K4me3-H2AK119ub 染色质结构域 (RNA-seq)**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、RNA-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Janith A Seneviratne ; Melanie A Eckersley-MaslinSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensEmbryonic regulators are often re-expressed in cancers, however the functional and molecular significance of this is not always understood. The epigenetic priming factors Developmental Pluripotency Associated 2 and 4 (DPPA2/4) have crucial roles in early development and are implicated in cancer pathogenesis. We reveal in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), DPPA2/4 co-expression is associated with poorly differentiated tumours and impaired patient outcomes. Biochemically, human DPPA2/4 multimerise for their protein stability and enhanced nucleosome binding activity. In NSCLC cells, DPPA2/4 bind CG-rich sequences including promoters of developmental, Wnt signaling and catabolic genes. Chromatin state modelling revealed DPPA2/4 preferentially bind active H3K4me3 and H3K27ac domains that were intriguingly also enriched for PRC1 and its product H2AK119ub, validated by H3K4me3-H2AK119ub sequential ChIP. Knockdown experiments revealed DPPA2/4 were required to maintain RING1B and H2AK119ub at these domains. Surprisingly, despite the presence of PRC2.1, these regions lacked any detectable H3K27me3, suggesting an uncoupling between the recruitment of PRC2 to chromatin and its catalytic product. When exogenously over-expressed in NSCLC cells where they are not normally present, DPPA2/4 bind to and promote active chromatin states, resulting in an increase in vivo xenograft tumour growth. Our results demonstrate how in NSCLC cells, DPPA2/4 act as molecular amplifiers of active and poised chromatin. Together, this highlights how aberrant re-activation of embryonic factors in cancers may take on new functions, promoting tumourigenesis.

**10.** **GSE272003 TAS1440，一种 LSD1 抑制剂，通过转录重编程破坏 INSM1-LSD1 复合物，从而激活神经内分泌小细胞肺癌中的肿瘤抑制通路 [ChIP-seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、ChIP-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Takumitsu Machida ; Yingbo Gong ; Sayaka Tsukioka ; Atsushi Onodera ; Akitoshi Nakayama ; Naoko Hashimoto ; Takahiro Fuchigami ; Satoshi Yamashita ; Tatsuya Suzuki ; Ryo Hatanaka ; Yasuo Kodama ; Shuichi Ohkubo ; Tomoaki TanakaSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by aggressive progression and limited treatment options, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies. Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1), a key epigenetic enzyme essential for maintaining the neuroendocrine phenotype, represses NOTCH and TGF-β signaling. Reactivation of these pathways suppresses proliferation and induces differentiation, underscoring LSD1's potential as a therapeutic target. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LSD1 inhibition and chemoresistance drivers remain poorly understood. Here, through structure-based engineering, we developed TAS1440, a potent histone H3-competitive LSD1 inhibitor designed to enhance specificity and reduce off-target effects. Unlike covalent inhibitors, which bind irreversibly to the FAD cofactor in LSD1, TAS1440 non-covalently targets the histone H3-binding pocket, improving safety and efficacy. TAS1440 demonstrated superior anti-proliferative activity in SCLC-A cells with high INSM1 and ASCL1 expression. In xenograft models, TAS1440 achieved over 70% tumor growth inhibition with minimal toxicity, highlighting its potential for SCLC. Mechanistically, integrated studies revealed that TAS1440 exerts dual mechanisms: direct inhibition of LSD1 enzymatic activity and disruption of LSD1-repressive complexes, thereby altering the histone modification landscape and activating transcription factors such as INSM1 and SMAD2. These actions coordinately reprogram tumor-suppressive pathways, including TGF-β and NOTCH signaling, positioning TAS1440 as an effective epigenetic therapy for SCLC. Importantly, Loss of LSD1 enzymatic activity and INSM1 knockout abrogated TAS1440’s effects, elucidating its mechanism of action and uncovering potential resistance pathways. These findings establish TAS1440 as a next-generation LSD1 inhibitor with dual actions on transcriptional regulation and epigenetic reprogramming. TAS1440 holds significant promise as a targeted therapy for SCLC, particularly for the SCLC-A subtype with high INSM1 expression.

- 📝 **描述**：Scientists have discovered that breast cancer can quietly throw the brain’s internal clock off balance—almost immediately after cancer begins. In mice, tumors flattened the natural daily rhythm of stress hormones, disrupting the brain-body feedback loop that regulates stress, sleep, and immunity. Remarkably, when researchers restored the correct day-night rhythm in specific brain neurons, stress hormone cycles snapped back into place, immune cells flooded the tumors, and the cancers shrank—without using any anti-cancer drugs.
