Antigen presenting cells play a critical role in influencing the differentiation of these T cells, but how the complex network of antigen presenting cells in the intestines drives commensal-specific T cells towards a variety of differentiation trajectories remains poorly understood. We examined the priming of T cells specific for the intestinal commensal bacterial species Akkermansia muciniphila, using the LIPSTIC system combined with single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify the APCs that prime A. muciniphila-specific T cells both at homeostasis when it elicits T follicular helper cells, and during inflammation, when it also elicits TH17 and TH1 cells. We found that A. muciniphila-specific T cells were primed by several transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of migratory cDC2s in both contexts. The identity of these subpopulations did not change with inflammation, but the distribution of presentation across the subpopulations shifted, with increased presentation by inflammatory cDC2s favoring TH1 and TH17 polarization. These results reveal how distinct T cell differentiation trajectories can be determined through varied interactions with multiple, functionally distinct subpopulations of APCs.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Kyoko Mastuki ; Taiki Sakaguchi ; Kiyoshi TakedaSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing ; OtherOrganism : Mus musculusThe intestinal epithelium undergoes robust maturation postnatally, yet its early-life characteristics remain poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we analyzed intestinal epithelial cells from neonatal and juvenile mice reared under both specific pathogen-free and germ-free conditions. Among the various cell types comprising the intestinal epithelia, we found that enterocytes, in particular, exhibit markedly different features between these stages. Enterocytes of neonatal mice show reduced expression of secretory host defense-related genes independently of microbial colonization. Conversely, neonatal enterocytes display upregulation of ketogenesis-related genes, which correlates with high expression of genes contributing to cell morphogenesis rather than serving primarily as an energy source. These findings provide novel insights into early-life maturation of intestinal epithelia offering implications for understanding neonatal intestinal pathologies.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Kyoko Mastuki ; Taiki Sakaguchi ; Kiyoshi TakedaSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusThe intestinal epithelium undergoes robust maturation postnatally, yet its early-life characteristics remain poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we analyzed intestinal epithelial cells from neonatal (10-day-old) and juvenile (21-day-old) mice reared under both specific pathogen-free and germ-free conditions. Among the various cell types comprising the intestinal epithelia, we found that enterocytes, in particular, exhibit markedly different features between these stages. Enterocytes of neonatal mice show reduced expression of secretory host defense-related genes independently of microbial colonization. These genes are upregulated in juvenile enterocytes in a microbiota-dependent manner. Conversely, neonatal enterocytes display upregulation of ketogenesis-related genes, which correlates with high expression of genes contributing to cell morphogenesis rather than serving primarily as an energy source.

**6.** ⭐ **GSE285901 PSY 通过靶向致癌信号传导和代谢重编程抑制结直肠癌进展**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、metabolic、regex:onco(logy|logist|gene|genic)
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Sanghee Han ; Seok-Geun LeeSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensBackground: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, driven by dysregulated oncogenic signaling and metabolic reprogramming. PSY, an herbal formula derived from Patriniae Radix, Coix Seed, and Mori Cortex Radicis, has shown potential anti-cancer effects, but its mechanisms in CRC remain unclear. Purpose: PSY’s multi-targeted effects on oncogenic signaling, metabolic pathways, and inflammation in CRC. Materials and Methods: Transcriptomic profiling (RNA sequencing), in vitro assays, and in vivo xenograft models were used to elucidate PSY’s mechanisms. Metabolic profiling via LC-MS/MS and serum lipid analysis were performed to assess its impact on lipid metabolism. Results: PSY activated the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 stress pathway and suppressed PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, inducing apoptosis and inhibiting CRC cell proliferation. Xenograft models showed significant tumor growth suppression and reduced proliferation (Ki67) and inflammation markers (COX2, p-STAT3). Metabolic profiling revealed reduced cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, including arachidonic acid, correlating with COX2 downregulation. Serum LDL and HDL levels decreased, with an increased LDL/HDL ratio. Conclusion: PSY demonstrates potential as a multi-targeted agent by disrupting oncogenic signaling, lipid metabolism, and inflammation in CRC. These findings support its further exploration for clinical applications.

**7.** **GSE292917 光呼吸与甲酸作为一碳源的 DNA 甲基化有关 [RNA-seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：RNA-seq、methylation
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Valentin Hankofer ; Martin GrothSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Arabidopsis thalianaDNA methylation is a key epigenetic modification regulating genome organization, stability, and gene expression. Stable DNA methylation critically relies on methyl groups provided through folate-mediated one-carbon (C1) metabolism, yet the origin and regulation of C1 supply remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that photorespiration serves as a major C1 source for DNA methylation in Arabidopsis. We show that C1 from formate, a photorespiratory byproduct, is incorporated into 5-methyl-cytosine via the reductive cytosolic folate pathway. This occurs predominantly during the day, negatively regulating serine utilization as alternative C1 source. Consequently, suppression of photorespiration under elevated CO₂ levels alters the DNA methylation landscape, an effect exacerbated when regulation of C1 metabolism by the formate-dependent pathway is impaired. Thus, our findings link the fundamental metabolic process of photorespiration to epigenetic stability, highlighting how rising atmospheric CO₂ levels can induce DNA methylation changes.

**9.** **GSE315350 微生物组来源的吲哚-3-乳酸通过芳烃受体通路减弱痤疮丙酸杆菌诱导的炎症**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：inflammation、pathway
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Sang Gyu Lee ; Nam Hao Chau ; Seoyoon Ham ; Yujin Baek ; Ngoc Ha Nguyen ; Young In LeeSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensAcne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis where conventional therapies of-ten face limitations in efficacy and safety, necessitating the development of microbi-ome-targeted interventions. This study investigated the immunomodulatory potential of microbiome-derived tryptophan metabolites as a novel therapeutic strategy for Cutibacterium acnes-induced inflammation, focusing on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. We evaluated indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), indole-3-acrylic acid (IAA), and indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) in comparison to tapinarof, utilizing C. ac-nes-stimulated human epidermal keratinocytes and a C. acnes-induced acne mouse model. In vitro, ILA and IPA significantly suppressed C. acnes-driven inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and COX2, whereas IAA demonstrated limited ef-ficacy. In vivo, ILA treatment exhibited superior therapeutic activity, markedly reduc-ing inflammatory cell infiltration, epidermal hyperplasia, and IL-1β expression. Tran-scriptomic analysis confirmed that ILA attenuates inflammatory signaling (e.g., IL-17 and TNF pathways) while upregulating AHR-responsive genes such as CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. Collectively, these findings establish ILA as a potent postbiotic that mitigates cutaneous inflammation through selective activation of the AHR. Future studies should prioritize the clinical translation of ILA-based topical fomulations, with rigorous evaluation of their efficacy and safety in well-designed human trials, to support their development as a non-antibiotic therapeutic alternative for acne management.

**10.** **GSE315348 瘦素激活的脑、棕色脂肪组织和心脏之间的串扰驱动缺血再灌注损伤后的心脏保护作用 [RNA-seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cardiac、RNA-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Series Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Rattus norvegicusCardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, with coronary artery disease being the primary contributor. Our recent studies suggest that activation of leptin receptors (LepRs) in the brain can improve cardiac function following myocardial infarction. However, the mechanism by which this cardioprotective effect is transmitted from the brain to the heart remains unclear. We hypothesize that brain LepR activation stimulates brown adipose tissue (BAT) to secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched with cardioprotective factors. These EVs may safeguard the heart by modulating cardiac mitochondrial function and collagen deposition. Our findings indicate that BAT ablation or BAT sympathetic denervation diminishes the cardioprotective effects of brain LepR activation. We also observed an increased concentration of EVs within BAT of rats treated with ICV leptin compared to vehicle-treated controls, an effect abolished by BAT denervation. Furthermore, knockdown of Rab27a in BAT reduced the cardioprotective benefits of brain LepR activation. MicroRNA (miR)-29c-3p was identified as a cargo of leptin-stimulated BAT-derived EVs and appears to play a key role in mitigating cardiac fibrosis after IR injury in leptin-treated animals. Thus, activation of LepR in the brain protects the heart after IR injury via sympathetic mediated BAT-derived EVs enriched with miR-29c-3p.
