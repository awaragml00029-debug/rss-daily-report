- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Devanand Sarkar ; Suchismita Raha ; Rachel Mendoza ; Xufeng Qu ; Jinze LiuSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Mus musculusAstrocyte elevated gene-1/Metadherin (AEG-1/MTDH) plays an important role in regulating lipid metabolism and inflammation in hepatocytes, and promotes metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Myeloid cells, such as macrophages, play a key role in regulating inflammation. Here we investigated the role of AEG-1 in myeloid cells in regulating high fat/high sugar diet (HF/HSD)-induced MASH. Both male and female AEG-1MAC mice were significantly protected from MASH development compared to AEG-1fl/fl mice.

**2.** ⭐ **GSE313941 S1PR1 在介导肿瘤中 CD8 + T 细胞功能障碍中的非经典功能 [RNASeq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、T cell、RNAseq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Debashree Basak ; Puspendu Ghosh ; Shilpak ChatterjeeSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusSphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) signaling has been linked to the regulation of immunosuppressive cell populations within the tumor microenvironment (TME); however, its role in shaping anti-tumor CD8⁺ T cell responses remains poorly defined. Herein, we demonstrate that intratumoral CD8⁺ T cells express S1PR1, with expression predominantly enriched in the terminally exhausted subset. Transcriptomic profiling, combined with pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockdown, reveals that S1PR1-S1P signaling activates the PERK (protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase)-CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein) axis of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. CHOP, in turn, upregulates transcription of Map3k13 and Map3k15, triggering downstream MAPK signaling and culminating in activation of p38MAPK. Activation of this pathway impairs CD8⁺ T cell metabolism and effector function while increasing apoptotic susceptibility. This ultimately limits the persistence and accumulation of functional CD8⁺ T cells within the TME, thereby compromising their responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy. Targeting the S1PR1-S1P axis or its downstream effectors offers a promising strategy to improve cancer immunotherapy outcomes.

However, monotherapy with ibrutinib or other BTKis generally does not induce complete remissions or undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) even with extended therapy. Therefore, there is a need to understand the differences between ibrutinib sensitive and resistant CLL cells along with the immune microenvironment to identify novel therapeutic approaches for controlling residual disease during BTKi treatment. Here, we investigated the cellular heterogeneity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib using single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified unique transcriptional heterogeneity within the B cell cluster in the ibrutinib-sensitive and resistant patients. Ibrutinib sensitive cells showed enrichment of B cell populations with upregulation of MHC I molecules and TNF family members. Additionally, we observed that inflammatory response and metabolism related pathways were decreased, whereas cellular response to stress and DNA repair programs were increased in the ibrutinib resistance samples. T cells in ibrutinib-resistant patients showed expansion of Tregs and an exhausted CD8 effector T cell compartment. Furthermore, CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes from ibrutinib resistant patients preferentially expressed a gene expression program of antiviral immunity. At the single-cell level, our findings demonstrate a picture of transcriptional heterogeneity in the tumor compartment and immune milieu. Overall, these findings suggest that T cell exhaustion and monocyte functional polarization may have a crucial role in BTKi resistance.

Recent work has demonstrated that some PTC-binding antibiotics act in a sequence-selective manner, inhibiting translation elongation at specific amino acids while the polypeptide is engaged in the PTC. However, this phenomenon has yet to be documented for compounds that inhibit translation by the human ribosome. Here we use structure-based design to guide synthesis of molecules called interdictors that bind to the human ribosome PTC and act in a context-selective manner to inhibit translation elongation. Using ribosome profiling, in combination with in vitro biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy, we characterize the context selectivity of unique analogues and observe their preferred interactions with nascent chain residues with complementary properties. Furthermore, we present a structure for an interdictor bound to a portion of the MYC protein at ~ 1.9 Å resolution and identify resulting structural rearrangements in both the nascent chain and ribosomal RNA. Finally, we document how these compounds differentially impact the ribotoxic stress response pathway which monitors ribosome collisions and can lead to apoptosis. Together, our data establish sequence-selective inhibition of translation as a novel small-molecule therapeutic modality for historically difficult to address cancers by targeting translation of oncogenic dependency factors in the human ribosome PTC.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Shuai Wang ; Sulei FuSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Ambystoma mexicanumThe Mexican axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is an established model for studying tetrapod regeneration and development. Notably, axolotls exhibit remarkable brain regeneration as adults, a trait rarely observed in other adult vertebrates. Adult axolotls can undergo metamorphosis, a process that induces dramatic remodeling of multiple organs and is accompanied by a gradual decline in regenerative capacity and lifespan. However, systematic studies on whole-brain cellular dynamics and molecular mechanisms in both adult and metamorphosed individuals remain lacking. Here, we profiled five representative brain regions (olfactory bulb, telencephalon, diencephalon/mesencephalon, rhombencephalon, and pituitary) of the axolotl brain via spatial transcriptomics in both adult and metamorphosed individuals. Our work reveals metamorphosis-associated changes in cell types and molecular profiles across brain regions.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、epigenetic
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Diego M Marzese ; Pere Llinàs-Arias ; Andrés F Bedoya-LópezSeries Type : Methylation profiling by genome tiling arrayOrganism : Homo sapiensTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a major cause of cancer mortality, with distant metastases, particularly to the lung, presenting a significant clinical challenge. While epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation (DNAm) are known to influence TNBC progression, their specific role in driving metastasis remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive multi-omics analysis, integrating epigenomic and transcriptomic profiles from TNBC xenograft models and patient cohorts. Genome-wide DNAm profiling of primary tumors, lymph nodes, and lung metastases revealed pronounced global hypomethylation in lung lesions, consistent with clinical samples. Promoter-methylation changes were enriched in pathways linked to invasion and proliferation, and transcriptomic integration identified 22 epigenetically regulated genes. Among these, elevated AK1, SLC2A5, TPI1, and ZBTB17 expression correlated with a higher risk of lung dissemination. These findings highlight aberrant methylation as a driver of TNBC lung colonization and identify candidate prognostic markers, emphasizing the importance of epigenetic reprogramming in organ-specific metastasis.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：nervous、RNA-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Laura Tamberg ; Carl Sander Kiir ; Jürgen Tuvikene ; Käthy Rannaste ; Mari Palgi ; Indrek Koppel ; Tõnis TimmuskSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Drosophila melanogasterDaughterless (Da), the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of mammalian E-protein transcription factor 4 (TCF4), is well studied in fruit fly embryonic development but its functions in adult nervous system are poorly understood. Mutations in human TCF4 gene lead to intellectual disabilities such as Pitt-Hopkins syndrome and TCF4 has also been linked to schizophrenia. Here, to explore the roles of Da in the Drosophila mature brain, we map Da DNA binding sites and study the transcriptomics of the brains where Da function is inhibited by pan-neuronal Extramacrohaete (Emc) overexpression, in both male and female Drosophila Our transcriptome analyses reveal that in the adult brain Da regulates the expression of genes involved in behavior, memory, synaptic signaling, protein translation, and metabolic processes. Moreover, combining the RNA sequencing data with Da ChIP sequencing results indicates that genes associated with neuronal projection guidance, metabolism, and translation are direct targets of Da. In addition, we validate the involvement of Da in memory formation. Overall, our results provide valuable information about the functions of Da in the adult brain and aid in better understanding the mechanisms of TCF4-related disorders.

**9.** **GSE317774 默克尔细胞癌中通过ATR抑制增强肿瘤免疫原性的机制**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、carcinoma
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Rashmi Bhakuni ; Junghyun Lee ; Peter Goff ; Daniel Jones ; Long Nguyen ; Rongxiang Lin ; Evan Newell ; Evan Hall ; Oren Gilad ; Eric J Brown ; Paul NghiemSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensThere is an urgent unmet need to develop novel therapeutic strategies for tumors that do not respond to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) via PD-1 pathway blockade. The ATR-mediated DNA replication checkpoint has been reported to have immune-augmenting properties; however, the mechanisms underlying these properties are not well characterized. Here we explore the potential immunogenic effects of ATR inhibition in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a cancer that is particularly relevant due to its high proliferative index and frequent response to anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. ATR inhibition induced tumor cell cytotoxicity in both Merkel cell polyomavirus-positive and UV-induced MCC cell lines in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. ATR inhibition alone or in combination with low-dose radiation induced numerous proinflammatory TNF-NF-κB signals as assessed via bulk transcriptomic profiling. These included increased expression of MHC class-I alleles, antigen processing machinery, interleukins, chemokines and interferon genes associated with anti-tumor immune responses in diverse tumor types. In parallel, we observed enhanced surface exposure of the “eat-me” signal calreticulin on MCC cells and subsequent phagocytosis by human monocyte-derived macrophages. Given that MCC tumors are often cGAS-STING-deficient (including two cell lines examined here), these ATRi-induced mechanisms are significant as they were activated regardless of cGAS-STING functional status. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the clinical evaluation of ATRi in advanced ICI-refractory MCC (NCT05947500), and suggest biomarkers that may be associated with response in human MCC tumors treated with ATRi.

**10.** **GSE317577 呼吸道病毒感染促进肺癌加速生长 [scATAC-Seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、scATAC
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Xiaoqin Wei ; Wei Qian ; Xiangyu Ye ; Jie SunSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted long-term health consequences of viral pneumonia, yet its potential impact on cancer development and growth remains poorly understood. Here, we show that prior SARS-CoV-2 or influenza infection accelerates lung tumor progression by reprogramming the local immune landscape. To test whether heightened cytokine responses after tumor initiation reflect durable epigenetic priming, we performed scATAC-seq on total lung cells from SARS-CoV-2–infected mice (28 d.p.i.) and PBS controls. Across macrophages, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, infection induced mild-to-moderate increases in chromatin accessibility at the Csf3 promoter and putative enhancers, with similar accessibility gains at Il6, Il1b, Cxcl1, and Cxcl5 loci in multiple compartments. Motif enrichment and regulon analyses further indicated increased accessibility/activity of NF-κB and AP-1, along with elevated STAT3/STAT4 activity. Collectively, these data demonstrate that prior respiratory viral infection drives long-lasting epigenetic remodeling of cytokine loci in lung immune and structural cells.
