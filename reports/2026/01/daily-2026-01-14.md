- 📝 **描述**：Contributor : Hailiang LiuSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusEpigenetic mechanisms are increasingly recognized as critical regulators of host-microbiota interactions. Here, we report that intestinal epithelial-specific deletion of Tet2, a key DNA demethylase, leads to structural abnormalities, impaired barrier function, and remarkable reprogramming of the gut microbial community. Mechanistically, Tet2 deficiency significantly downregulated the expression of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT/Slc10a2), resulting in altered bile acid homeostasis with specific accumulation of hyocholic acid (HCA) in the intestinal lumen. This metabolic shift created a favorable niche for selective expansion of bile salt hydrolase (BSH)-expressing Lactobacillus species. Furthermore, we identified an age-dependent regulatory role of HCA in shaping microbial composition, promoting Lactobacillus in young mice while enriching Akkermansia in aged animals. Our findings unveil an epigenetic-metabolic-microbial axis centered on Tet2-mediated regulation of bile acid metabolism, providing new insights into how host epigenetic factors shape the gut microbial ecosystem.

**3.** ⭐ **GSE279103 布鲁顿酪氨酸激酶抑制剂可挽救由B细胞介导的淋巴毒素-α释放引起的神经元损伤**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：B cell、Neuronal、kinase
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Paul Götz ; Nesrin Sharif ; Nicholas Hanuscheck ; Josef Shin ; Frauke ZippSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensAlthough B cell depletion slows disability accrual in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), the role of B cells in MS-associated neuronal injury remains elusive. B cells release cytokines such as lymphotoxin-α (LTα), and this proinflammatory protein is also present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and meninges of pwMS. B cell-specific ablation of LTα alleviates disease severity in a preclinical model of MS. To further study the impact of B cell-derived cytokines on neuronal function, we performed patch-clamp recordings on human iPSC-derived neurons. Coculture with proinflammatory human B cells led to depolarization and aberrant firing. Pretreatment of proinflammatory B cells with a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), reported in patients to beneficially affect disability progression even in the absence of inflammatory relapse activity, prevented neuronal impairment and inhibited LTα release from B cells. Blocking LTα, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), or receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 or 3 also prevented neuronal impairment, but blocking TNFα or LTβ had no such effect. Neuronal impairment was reversible by BTKi or blockage of LTα, and this reversibility was dependent on the activity of acid sphingomyelinase. In pwMS, LTα correlated with elevated neurofilament light chain (NfL) abundance in CSF, and anti-CD20 B cell-depletion therapy led to a reduction in circulating LTα, supporting the role of B cells as a regulator for LTα. These findings highlight the negative impact of B cell-derived LTα on neurons and suggest potential treatment avenues for MS-associated neuronal injury.

**6.** **GSE315981 揭示 GATA1 N 端在红细胞发育中的关键代谢作用 [批量 RNA 测序]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：metabolic、RNA-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Te Ling ; Rashid Mehmood ; John D CrispinoSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensMutations in GATA1 that result in skipping of exon 2, which encodes the N-terminus, are associated with the myeloid leukemia of Down syndrome and Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA). To elucidate the molecular functions of the N-terminus, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of fetal liver cells derived from Gata1 mutant embryos that express the GATA1 short (GATA1s) isoform in place of full-length GATA1 (GATA1FL). scRNA-seq highlighted defects in erythropoiesis and revealed that the absence of the N-terminus resulted in elevated expression of genes involved in glycolysis, such as the rate-limiting pyruvate kinase PKM. To elucidate the regulation of the PKM gene, we performed precision nuclear run-on sequencing and cleavage under targets and release using nuclease on erythroid cells following acute deletion of GATA1 and determined that PKM is a direct target of GATA1. Mechanistically, we found that substitution of GATA1FL with GATA1s led to increased glycolysis in erythroid progenitor cells but did not affect oxidative phosphorylation. We further discovered that the expression of PKM is significantly elevated in DBA patients with RPS19 mutations, consistent with a role for GATA1 regulation of glycolysis in erythropoiesis. Together, these findings reveal that GATA1 controls not just heme metabolism, but also glycolysis.

**7.** **GSE299651 结直肠癌单细胞筛选鉴定出由癌基因激活的具有临床意义的转录模块**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、single-cell
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Viola Hollek ; Francisca Böhning ; Markus Morkel ; Nils BlüthgenSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensWhile oncogenic mutations shape colorectal cancer biology and therapy response, their prognostic value remains low. Cluster-based classification of patient cancer transcriptomes has shown greater promise for prognosis, yet these systems do not account for the roles of oncogenes in establishing cancer phenotypes. Here, we create and validate a prognostic classifier for colorectal cancer based on transcriptional programs induced by oncogenes.To systematically investigate oncogenic drivers, we employed a barcoded library of colorectal cancer-associated oncogene variants across a panel of genetically diverse colorectal cancer cell lines. We profiled the transcriptomes of over 100,000 transgenic cells and used machine learning to define transcriptional modules capturing key functional traits.Our analysis revealed heterogeneity on the cell-to-cell level and context-dependent gene expression patterns induced by oncogenes. We identified overarching gene expression modules reflecting core oncogenic processes, including cancer cell plasticity, inflammatory response, replicative stress, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These modules enabled a functional classification that linked oncogenic signalling states to distinct transcriptional profiles. We demonstrated their prognostic value by stratifying clinical colorectal cancer cohorts into high- and low-risk groups. Although partially correlated with established clinical parameters, the modules provided additional prognostic information, improving survival prediction and therapy stratification beyond existing classification systems.In summary, our study establishes a framework that connects oncogenic mutations to core transcriptional modules. By integrating experimental models with clinical data, we provide a resource for investigating colorectal cancer progression and oncogene-specific vulnerabilities, facilitating future research and precision oncology.

**8.** **GSE291201 ATRX 缺失将富含 G 的重复序列处的基因组不稳定性与人类 α-珠蛋白表达失调联系起来 [scRNA-seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：scRNA、genome
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Yuqi Shen ; Sean WenSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensGermline mutations in the chromatin remodelling protein ATRX cause a severe developmental disorder associated with α-thalassemia. In addition, ATRX is amongst the twenty genes most frequently mutated in cancer. How ATRX mutations alter gene expression remains unclear. Using the α-globin locus as a model, here we show that ATRX deficiency downregulates α-globin in a subset of cells exhibiting DNA damage. A G-rich repeat at the α-globin locus serves as a potential site of G-quadruplex formation and DNA damage. ATRX binds this repeat co-transcriptionally, and its loss increases R-loop accumulation at this site, leading to local DNA damage and transcriptional disruption in cis. Deletion of this repeat abolishes this effect, while targeted DNA damage reinstates it. These findings reveal a mechanism linking ATRX’s role in genome stability to transcriptional regulation, and uncover a molecular basis of human genetic disease mediated by a long-range G-rich repeat.

**10.** **GSE289112 泥蟹（Scylla paramamosain）血细胞在感染白斑综合征病毒（WSSV）前后的单细胞转录组测序**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：sequencing、transcriptome
- 📝 **描述**：Contributor : Hu HangSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Scylla paramamosainWe used the BDA DNBelabC4 platform to conduct single-cell RNA transcriptome sequencing on hemocytes before and after infection with WSSV, and to study the changes in hemocytes composition and antiviral mechanism of a crustacean virus infection represented by mud crab. The blood cells, or hemocytes, of the mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) play crucial roles in its innate immune system. These cells are involved in various immune responses, including phagocytosis, encapsulation, and the production of antimicrobial peptides. The hemocytes can be isolated and characterized using techniques such as flow cytometry, which helps in understanding their functions and interactions within the crab's immune system. White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) is a highly contagious and lethal virus that primarily infects crustaceans, particularly shrimp and crabs. It is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus, typically oval-shaped, measuring about 320nm in length and 100nm in width, making it one of the largest known viruses. WSSV is the causative agent of White Spot Syndrome, a disease that has caused significant economic losses in the aquaculture industry.
