**1.** ⭐ **GSE281519 PARP抑制剂的溶酶体隔离驱动卵巢癌中的异质性积累以提高疗效[空间转录组学]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、spatial、spatial transcriptomics、transcriptomics
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Carmen Ramirez Moncayo ; Restuadi Restuadi ; Louise FetsSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Homo sapiensPARP inhibitors have had a transformative impact in the treatment of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), but resistance remains a clinical hurdle. Increased expression of ABC drug efflux transporters has been identified as a resistance mechanism in patients but whether intracellular concentrations of these drugs is heterogeneous within tumours remains unclear. We developed a patient-derived explant multi-modal imaging pipeline which demonstrated significant cell-intrinsic heterogeneity of PARP inhibitor accumulation, both between patients and within tumours. Spatial transcriptomics revealed enrichment of apoptotic signatures in high-drug compared to low-drug regions, as well as metabolic and ECM-related differences. While some cases demonstrated a clear anticorrelation of PARP inhibitor levels with MDR1(ABCB1), this was not universal. Rucaparib, an intrinsically fluorescent PARP inhibitor accumulates heterogeneously at the single cell-level in established cell lines, and omics approaches revealed that this is driven by lysosomal sequestration, a pattern also observed in patient samples. Perturbation of lysosomal content altered intracellular levels of rucaparib and niraparib and impacted efficacy suggesting that lysosomes act as a drug reservoir to improve drug response.

**2.** ⭐ **GSE315178 9-PAHSA 调控 TCR-T 细胞命运以增强抗肿瘤免疫力 [ATAC-seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、immunity、T cell、ATAC-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributor : Xiaozhen ZhangSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusWe identify the endogenous lipid 9-PAHSA as a potent enhancer of T cell anti-tumor function and stemness, validated in murine models and a clinical trial. Mechanistically, we identify ICAM2 as a direct surface sensor for 9-PAHSA and delineate a downstream signaling axis whereby the ICAM2-Ezrin-mTORC2 cascade drives FOXO1 O-GlcNAcylation at S318, facilitating its nuclear translocation to enact a stem-like transcriptional program. Translating this discovery, we engineered armored human TCR-T cells with potentiated ICAM2 expression, which achieve superior tumor control through their enhanced intrinsic efficacy and a remarkable ability to ignite a coordinated and durable host anti-tumor immune response. Our work establishes a new paradigm of metabolite-sensing in T cell biology and provides a compelling therapeutic strategy to potentiate cellular immunotherapy for intractable cancers.

**3.** ⭐ **GSE310383 年龄无关且可靶向的转录因子网络调控衰老人类 CD8+ T 细胞衰老 [ATAC-Seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：aging、T cell、ATAC-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Paolo S Turano ; Elizabeth Akbulut ; Hannah K Dewald ; Themistoklis Vasilopoulos ; Patricia Fitzgerald-Bocarsly ; Utz Herbig ; Ricardo Iván Martínez-ZamudioSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensAging impairs immunity in part through the accumulation of CD8+ T cells with senescence features, including a pro-inflammatory transcriptome and impaired proliferative capacity. Using senescent cell isolation coupled with multiomic profiling, we defined the epigenetic regulation of CD8+ T cell senescence in healthy younger and older humans. We discovered that the transition to senescence was controlled by chromatin state-specific transcription factor (TF) networks whose composition was largely insensitive to donor age. These TF networks mediated widespread enhancer remodeling, causing repression of genes essential for proliferation as well as upregulation of inflammatory and secretory pathways. Inhibition of AP1, KLF5, or RUNX2 modulated the transcriptional output and partially restored the blunted transcriptional response to stimulation of senescent CD8+ T cells. Our data also revealed CD8+ T cell senescence gene signatures predictive of response to CAR-T cell therapy in diffuse large B cell lymphomas. Overall, our study defines the gene regulatory mechanisms of senescence in human CD8+ T cells, provides a resource for the interrogation of CD8+ T cell senescence in disease, highlights TF network perturbation as a viable strategy to manipulate the senescence state of CD8+ T cells, and reveals senescent CD8+ T cell gene signatures as valuable prognostic tools for immunotherapy outcome.

**5.** ⭐ **GSE218539 人类左心耳和肺静脉袖的空间转录组学**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：spatial、spatial transcriptomics、transcriptomics
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Han Sun ; Juying Han ; Christine S Moravec ; Toshihiro Okamoto ; Kenneth R McCurry ; A M Gillinov ; Mina K Chung ; Davd R Van Wagoner ; John Barnard ; Jonathan D SmithSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensHuman left atrial appendage (LAA) and pulmonary vein (PV) tissues were obtained from unused lung or heart transplant donors. Paired LAA and PV sleeve tissues were obtained from two subjects, and an additional 6 PV samples were obtained from other donors. After tissue sectioning and staining, spatial RNAseq was performed. mRNAs from~1000 to 2500 genes were sequenced in each spatial area. Seurat clustering yielded 15 different clusters. These grossly split into two segregating populations, the left and right sides, with one connecting population. Multiple cells and cell types may reside in each 55 µm diameter spatial area. A clear asymmetry of clusters was observed in the PV sections, with less asymmetry in the LAA sections. Cell-type marker genes derived from human LAA single nuclei RNAseq were used to determine the dominant cell types in the 15 different clusters. The left side segregating clusters were enriched in cardiomyocytes, while the right side segregating clusters were enriched for other cell types including fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and adipocytes. Spatial transcriptomics clearly resolved the venous, cardiomyocyte, and epicardial regions of the PV tissues, as well as fibrotic regions in LAAs and PVs. Spatial expression of the AF-associated genes PITX2, SHOX2, and HCN4 was also mapped, confirming higher expression of the cardiac master transcription factor SHOX2 in the PV vs. LAA tissues. Expression of the hyperpolarization-activated ion channel HCN4 was sporadic in both PV and LAA specimens.

Most of these cancers are sarcomas, which uniquely express the RNase IIIb domain-deficient form of DICER1 and exhibit histological and molecular similarities regardless of their anatomical origins. To uncover their cellular origin and developmental hierarchy, we established a lineage-traceable genetically engineered mouse model allowing for controlled activation of Dicer1 mutations in Hic1+ mesenchymal stromal cells. This resulted in the development of renal tumors closely mirroring human DICER1 sarcoma histologically and molecularly. Spatial single-cell transcriptomics analysis revealed that a Hic1+Pdgfra+Dpt+Pi16+ fibroblastic progenitor population, corresponding to universal fibroblasts of steady-state kidneys, exhibits the capability to undergo rhabdomyoblastic differentiation or transition into proliferative sarcomatous cells. Investigation of patient samples identified analogous cell states and developmental trajectories. This study uncovers a fibroblastic origin for DICER1 sarcoma and provides a faithful model for future mechanistic and translational investigation.

When gut bacteria are stressed by these chemicals, some may also become resistant to antibiotics. The research raises new questions about how chemical exposure could be influencing human health behind the scenes.

- 📝 **描述**：New research shows gut bacteria can directly influence how the brain develops and functions. When scientists transferred microbes from different primates into mice, the animals’ brains began to resemble those of the original host species. Microbes from large-brained primates boosted brain energy and learning pathways, while others triggered very different patterns. The results suggest gut microbes may have played a hidden role in shaping the human brain—and could influence mental health.

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer
- 📝 **描述**：A protein once thought to simply help cancer cells avoid death turns out to do much more. MCL1 actively drives cancer metabolism by controlling the powerful mTOR growth pathway, tying survival and energy use together. This insight explains why MCL1-targeting drugs can be effective—but also why they sometimes damage the heart. Researchers have now identified a way to reduce that risk, potentially unlocking safer cancer therapies.
