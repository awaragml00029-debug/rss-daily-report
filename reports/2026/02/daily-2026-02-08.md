- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Li Yang ; Lanlan ShenSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusDuring weaning, the transition to solid food diversifies the gut microbiome, triggering a programmed immune response critical for long-lasting mucosal immunity. Previous work showed that the gut microbiome mediates epigenetic development in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) during suckling, but what happens during weaning is unclear. Here, using genome-wide methylation profiling revealed that weaning-driven microbiome changes shape the DNA methylome and transcriptome of murine ISCs in an IFN-g dependent manner. Specifically, we observe demethylation of enhancer elements essential for MHC class II genes, which result in a transcriptional memory that persists through differentiation into adulthood. IFN-g blockade, or low-dose penicillin to target Gram-positive bacteria, in early life impaired microbiome-mediated epigenetic control and mucosal immunity, and exacerbated colitis. Murine organoids primed with IFN-g showed rapid, amplified transcriptional responses upon secondary stimulations. These findings reveal that early-life events alter the gut microbiome and these changes reprogram ISC epigenetic memory to shape mucosal immunity.

Here, we confirm that VCAN accumulates within colorectal cancers (CRCs) and inhibits T cell trafficking/effector function. VCAN is heavily proteolyzed in a subset of CRCs (VCAN proteolytic predominant (VPP)), leading to enhanced T cell infiltration. This phenotype was found to be more common in oligometastatic CRCs. A phase 1b clinical trial examined the safety/efficacy of the sequential combination of stereotactic body radiotherapy and pembrolizumab in patients undergoing resection of their microsatellite stable oligometastatic CRCs. The primary endpoint was met with a 1-year recurrence free survival (RFS) of 60%. Of those enrolled, 40% of cancers had the VPP phenotype, which was associated with improved RFS and overall survival. The VPP phenotype was associated with improved circulating T cell effector function, which was enhanced with study treatment. Clinical trial information: NCT02837263.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Juan Dubrot ; Jesús Prieto ; Elizabeth Guruceaga ; Sonia MarcoSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusRadiotherapy (RT) primes the immune system against cancer antigens but fails to trigger effective antitumor responses due to concomitant induction of immunosuppressive factors. To expand the benefits of RT, we combine local radiation with immuno-gene therapy by harnessing the ability of ionizing radiation to enhance AAV-mediated tumor transduction. To successfully deliver AAV-based local immunotherapy and restrict transgene expression within tumors, we designed a recombinant AAV that expresses IL-12 through an interferon (IFN)-inducible promoter (AAV-iIL12). Local administration of AAV-iIL12 upon RT results in marked and durable elevation of intratumor IL-12 with minor and transient systemic release. This strategy generates a highly immunostimulatory tumor microenvironment (TME) leading to strong antitumor responses in an IFNg-dependent manner. Moreover, local treatment with RT and AAV-iIL12 elicits systemic antitumor immunity with marked CD8+ T cell infiltration and regression of distant tumors. Our work shows that radiation coupled with AAV-based immuno-gene delivery is a novel, efficient and safe approach that can be exploited as cancer therapy.

**5.** ⭐ **GSE279313 TGF-β 控制 IFN 抗病毒训练免疫的表观遗传重编程并损害 SIV 感染恒河猴的病毒控制 [bulk RNA-seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：immunity、RNA-seq、epigenetic
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Felipe ten-Caten ; Khader Ghneim ; Mirko Paiardini ; Susan P Ribeiro ; Rafick P SekalySeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Macaca mulattaCurrent immunotherapeutic approaches to eliminate latently HIV-infected cells have focused on targeting the adaptive arm of the immune system using vaccines and passive transfer of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Epigenetic reprogramming of innate myeloid cells triggered by adjuvants was recently shown to promote a state of interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral immunity and resistance to heterologous viral infections. Herein, flow cytometry, bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq/ATAC-Seq were performed on samples from a cohort of SIV-infected, virologically suppressed rhesus macaques (RMs) treated with anti-IL-10 and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies (combo treatment) prior to analytical treatment interruption (ATI). These experiments revealed that combo treatment led to selective changes in chromatin accessibility, expression of IRF7/3 and STAT1, and expression of IFN-stimulated antiviral genes in myeloid cells and CD4+ T cells. These RMs showed a stringent and prolonged control of SIV viral rebound following ATI and a decay in levels of cell-associated viral DNA (CA-vDNA) in lymph nodes. These RMs showed reduced chromatin accessibility for the SMAD2/SMAD3, AP-1, and NFKB1 loci and lower expression of TGF-b and SMADs target genes. This signature is consistent with that observed in HIV elite controllers, who maintain undetectable levels of virus in the absence of ART and whose HIV reservoir size is small. These results highlight the critical role of the interplay between TGF-b and IFN in epigenetically regulated innate antiviral immune responses that can impact the viral reservoir.

Perturb-seq enables systematic mapping of such networks, but large-scale application in primary human T cells has been challenging. Here, we developed a scalable, probe-based Perturb-seq platform and performed genome-scale perturbations of all expressed genes across 22 million primary CD4+ T cells from four donors under three stimulation conditions. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset in three ways. First, we identify previously unrecognized regulators of the two important immune cytokines, IL-10 and IL-21. Second, we show that ex vivo perturbation signatures can model T cell states observed in population-scale atlases, revealing regulators of helper T cell polarization and T cell aging. Third, we leverage regulatory relationships to mechanistically explain gene–trait associations in immune-related diseases, nominating genes for uncharacterized immune functions. Thus genome-scale perturb-seq in primary human T cells provides a foundational resource for decoding immune variation in humans and reprogramming T cell states for next-generation precision therapies.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：gut、regex:gut(-?microbiome)?、regex:intestin(e|al)
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Li Yang ; Lanlan ShenSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Mus musculusDuring weaning, the shift from milk to solid food is accompanied by a rapid expansion and diversification of the gut microbiome. This triggers the weaning reaction, a programmed immune response important for long-lasting mucosal immunity that is poorly understood. Here, we characterize the impact of the gut microbiome on the DNA methylome and transcriptome of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) from weaning to young adulthood in mice. We identify a weaning- IFN-g-TET3 axis that reprograms epithelial MHC-II signaling via enhancer demethylation in ISCs, establishing a lasting transcriptional memory into adulthood. Disruption of this axis by IFN-g blockade or low-dose penicillin attenuates the microbiota-mediated epigenetic control of epithelial MHC-II signaling, leading to impaired mucosal immunity. By engaging immune crosstalk and metabolite production, the weaning microbiome drives epigenetic reprogramming, thereby establishing a microbiome-induced regulatory pathway that couples developmental cues to lifelong epithelial immune resilience.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Li Yang ; Lanlan ShenSeries Type : Methylation profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusDuring weaning, the transition from milk to solid food rapidly expands and diversifies the gut microbiome, triggering the weaning reaction, a programmed immune response critical for long-lasting mucosal immunity. We characterized how these microbiome changes from weaning through young adulthood in mice shape the DNA methylome and transcriptome of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). We identified a weaning-induced IFN-g–TET3 axis as a key driver of MHC class II enhancer-linked epigenetic reprogramming, creating a transcriptional memory that persists through differentiation into adulthood. Early-life disruption of this axis, via IFN-g blockade or low-dose penicillin, impaired microbiota-mediated epigenetic control and mucosal immunity. Weaning-associated microbiome shifts enriched metabolites such as α-ketoglutarate, Fe2+, and methionine g-lyase, promoting TET-dependent DNA demethylation. These findings reveal how early-life events imprint lifelong epigenetic regulation of mucosal immunity, highlighting epithelial cells as innate immune sentinels that acquire trained transcriptional memory in response to microbial cues.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：lymphoma、T cell、single-cell
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Xiaozhen Liang ; Rong Tao ; Ran Jia ; Chuanxu LiuSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensNatural killer/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is a rare and aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection.The recent advancement of multi-omics technologies has significantly enhanced our understanding of NKTCL disease biology, including genetics, transcription landscape, variations of EBV strain, and microenvironments. Emerging evidence suggests that immunoprofiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is associated with the treatment response of cancer patients and can be used to guide clinical trials and therapy. In this study, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize the phenotypic landscape of PBMCs in newly diagnosed patients with NKTCL. This research offers a valuable peripheral blood-based signature for newly diagnosed NKTCL, which could be a crucial resource for further investigations into the pathogenesis of NKTCL and the optimization of therapeutic regimens.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Anna Galligos ; Joseph Varberg ; Wei-Ting Yueh ; Aubrey Converse ; Seth Malloy ; Fatimah Aljubran ; Francesca E Duncan ; Jennifer L GertonSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Mus musculusAge-dependent reproductive decline has become a significant global health concern as the average maternal age at first birth increases. Fertility loss associated with reproductive aging is driven in part by alterations to ovarian composition and function, dysregulation of folliculogenesis and increased inflammatory signaling. Our understanding of the molecular changes underlying ovarian aging has been expanded by single cell and spatial transcriptomic studies, which identified infiltration of immune cells as a feature of ovarian aging. However, the function of these age-associated immune cells and their potential contributions to the inflammaging phenotype remains unclear. In this study we integrate single cell and spatial transcriptomics to define changes in the composition and intercellular signaling in the aging mouse ovary. We identify specific macrophage and T cell subpopulations that increase with age and are key sources of pro-inflammatory signaling in old ovaries. Further, we predict bidirectional signaling between these pro-inflammatory cells and granulosa cell populations that may impair follicular growth and development while promoting immune cell recruitment. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms that drive ovarian inflammaging.

The balance between these “good” and “bad” cells can determine whether a tumor grows or shrinks.
