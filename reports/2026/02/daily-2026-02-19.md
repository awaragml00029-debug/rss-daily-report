Spatial transcriptomics (ST) offers valuable insights into spatial complexity and heterogeneity of TME. We established a Python package, Geographic Information System (GIS)-augmented In-Silico Reconstruction of Tumor Architecture (GIS-ROTA), based on application of GIS methods to ST data to examine/explore spatial heterogeneity of co-regulated gene sets, such as pathways and cell types within the TME. In our Visium dataset of primary and metastatic estrogen receptor positive breast tumor samples, GIS-ROTA revealed extensive co-localization of estrogen response with metabolic pathway gene sets and mutual exclusivity with metastasis-related and specific immune-related pathway gene sets. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of GIS-ROTA in quantitating tumor heterogeneity and identifying spatially significant regions while minimizing the subjectivity involved in interpreting the clusters from conventional statistical methods. Thus, GIS-ROTA enables the development of therapeutic strategies that target multiple cell populations.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Robin Pranter ; Cedric Patthey ; Nathalie FeinerSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Podarcis muralisSingle-cell transcriptomic data were generated from embryos of the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis). Neural crest cells (NCCs) were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting based on HNK-1 antibody staining. The dataset includes two unsorted samples representing all embryonic cells, one leniently sorted sample containing the top 15% of HNK-1–positive cells, and two strictly sorted samples containing the top 5% of HNK-1–positive cells. Unsorted and leniently sorted samples were generated from pools of three embryos each and sequenced using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform. Strictly sorted samples were generated from a single embryo, split across two plates, and sequenced using the Smart-seq3 protocol. These data enable characterization of NCC transcriptional profiles in a non-model vertebrate species and provide a resource for studying neural crest biology in systems lacking transgenic tools.

**4.** ⭐ **GSE318783 通过 LHRH-NanoTi 靶向递送 TGF-β 抑制剂可逆转卵巢癌中 NAT10/ac4C 介导的顺铂诱导的免疫抑制性肿瘤微环境 [RNA-Seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、cancer、tumor microenvironment、RNA-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributor : Fei LvSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusBackground: Platinum-based chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is frequently compromised by the development of resistance, a process often accompanied by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The molecular mechanisms linking cisplatin resistance to immune evasion remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective combination therapies. Results: This study reveals that cisplatin-induced immunosuppression and resistance are driven by a reduction in N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10)-mediated N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) modification, which produces two parts of unfavorable effects: 1) activating the DNA damage repair pathway, thereby confers resistance to cisplatin; 2) enhancing the expression of TGF-β via NAT10's interaction with ribosomal proteins RPS3 and RPS6. The elevated TGF-β increases the infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), M2 macrophages, exhausted CD8+ T cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) within the tumor microenvironment. To target this pathway, we developed a LHRH receptor-targeted nanodelivery system for a TGF-β inhibitor, which synergized with cisplatin to achieve superior antitumor efficacy by effectively reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Conclusions: Our study defines the NAT10/ac4C–TGF-β axis as a pivotal mechanism coordinating cisplatin resistance and immunosuppression in ovarian cancer. These findings propose targeted inhibition of TGF-β signaling as a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome platinum resistance by revitalizing the antitumor immune response.

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Mustafa Özdemir ; Saffet Teber ; Ghulam Asghar Sajid ; Selma Büyükkılıç Beyzi ; Yunus Arzık ; Mehmet Kızılaslan ; Servet Yalçın ; Mehmet Ulas CinarSeries Type : Methylation profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Gallus gallusPre-incubation formaldehyde (FA) fumigation of hatching eggs is widely implemented for microbial control, yet its epigenetic consequences in embryonic tissues remain unclear. Here, we profiled the methylome of chicken embryo liver and skeletal muscle following commercial-dose FA fumigation using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). We generated 16 WGBS libraries (per tissue: control n=4; FA n=4), producing ~1.80 billion clean reads with mapping rates of 88.1–89.9% and bisulfite conversion efficiencies of ~99.4–99.7%. Although global methylation patterns were largely maintained, FA exposure induced widespread locus-specific remodeling dominated by CpG hypomethylation in both tissues. We identified 10,496 DMRs in liver and 10,487 DMRs in muscle, with hypomethylated DMRs comprising 83.4% and 91.2%, respectively. Functional enrichment analyses revealed a tissue-specific adaptive logic. In liver, CG-DMR–associated genes were significantly enriched in Focal adhesion, Tight junction, and core signaling pathways (MAPK, Wnt, Insulin signaling). Notably, hypermethylated genes were enriched for Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, whereas hypomethylated genes were enriched for Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum and Autophagy. In the CHG context, hypomethylation preferentially involved ether lipid metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, and cell–cell adhesion pathways (Adherens junction, Focal adhesion), while CHH-context hypermethylation enriched MAPK and tight junctions. In muscle, CG-DMRs were enriched for “housekeeping” stress-response pathways (Autophagy, Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis), while a distinct metabolic signature emerged: hypermethylated genes were enriched for PPAR signaling and Biosynthesis of amino acids, whereas hypomethylated genes enriched for Fatty acid metabolism. A decisive metabolic switch was evident in the CHH context, where promoters of Biosynthesis of amino acids were hypermethylated, while catabolic energy pathways (Fatty acid degradation, Valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, TCA cycle) were hypomethylated. Collectively, these data demonstrate that commercial-dose FA fumigation leaves tissue- and context-specific epigenetic imprints in embryonic liver and skeletal musc...

**6.** ⭐ **GSE319318 CDKN2A-ARF 失活促进 PDAC 肿瘤微环境的 p53 非依赖性重塑 [RNA-Seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、tumor microenvironment、RNA-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Brittany M Flowers ; Sofia Ferreira ; Laura D AttardiSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusThe CDKN2A locus, which is frequently deleted in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), encodes two tumor suppressors, ARF and INK4A, that may influence tumorigenesis through distinct mechanisms. Distinguishing their individual contributions to cancer could help improve the understanding of PDAC pathogenesis and potentially uncover targetable vulnerabilities. Moreover, while ARF is known to enhance p53 function, defining its p53-independent activities could elucidate new processes that drive PDAC development. Here, we sought to understand ARF function in PDAC suppression. Analysis of gene expression and mutational patterns in human PDAC TCGA data indicated that CDKN2AARF and CDKN2AINK4A are commonly both affected by point mutations and/or deletions, suggesting that their combined inactivation contributes to PDAC development. In genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), Arf inactivation accelerated KRASG12D-driven PDAC development, both in the presence and absence of Trp53, demonstrating that ARF is a PDAC suppressor and can act in a p53-independent manner. Transcriptomic analyses of PDACs supported a p53-independent role for ARF, with ARF deficiency promoting extracellular matrix, collagen synthesis/assembly, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition gene expression programs. Accordingly, ARF-deficient PDACs displayed extensive remodeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME), associated with collagen deposition, increased tissue stiffness, and higher fibroblast content – hallmarks of aggressive and treatment-resistant PDAC stroma. Together, this study shows how ARF deficiency associated with CDKN2A inactivation sculpts the PDAC TME in a p53-independent fashion. Given the central role of the TME in PDAC progression and therapeutic resistance, these findings may provide insight critical for improving therapeutic interventions for PDAC.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、cancer、immunity
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Kristi Baker ; Shayla MosleySeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusPatients with the microsatellite instable (MSI) subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC) have better prognosis and immunotherapy response than patients with the chromosomally instable (CIN) subtype due to improved cytotoxic T cell responses. This is in part due to high production of the chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5 from constitutive activation of the cytosolic DNA (cyDNA) sensor cGAS/STING by specific features of MSI cyDNA that lead to more effective cGAS/STING pathway activation. Here, we investigate MSI and CIN cyDNA structure and show that MSI cyDNA is enriched in G-quadruplexes which improve cGAS/STING and CD8+ T cell activation. We also show that micronuclei are less effective at inducing anti-tumor immunity and instead increase Treg activation and IL10 production. Overall, these data highlight the role of specific cyDNA structures in anti-tumor immunity and provide knowledge for improved design of therapeutic DNA-based cGAS/STING agonists to improve the prognosis of poorly immunogenic tumors like CIN CRCs.

**10.** **GSE319696 Setdb1 介导的 H3K9 甲基化在非活性 X 染色体上富集，并在其表观遗传沉默中发挥作用 [MEF_RNAseq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：epigenetic、methylation
- 📝 **描述**：Series Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusThe presence of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation on the mouse inactive X chromosome has been controversial over the last 15 years, and the functional role of H3K9 methylation in X chromosome inactivation in any species has remained largely unexplored. Here we report the first genomic analysis of H3K9 di- and tri-methylation on the inactive X: we find they are enriched at the intergenic, gene poor regions of the inactive X, interspersed between H3K27 tri-methylation domains found in the gene dense regions. Although H3K9 methylation is predominantly non-genic, we find that depletion of H3K9 methylation via depletion of H3K9 methyltransferase Set domain bifurcated 1 (Setdb1) during the establishment of X inactivation, results in failure of silencing for around 150 genes on the inactive X. By contrast, we find a very minor role for Setdb1-mediated H3K9 methylation once X inactivation is fully established. In addition to failed gene silencing, we observed a specific failure to silence X-linked long-terminal repeat class repetitive element. Here we have shown that H3K9 methylation clearly marks the murine inactive X chromosome. The role of this mark is most apparent during the establishment phase of gene silencing, with a more muted effect on maintenance of the silent state. Based on our data, we hypothesise that Setdb1-mediated H3K9 methylation plays a role in epigenetic silencing of the inactive X via silencing of the repeats, which itself facilitates gene silencing through alterations to the conformation of the whole inactive X chromosome.
