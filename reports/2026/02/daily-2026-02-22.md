**1.** ⭐ **GSE313827 研究发现，癌症相关成纤维细胞中 Hippo 通路的失调与抗 PD-L1 抗体阿特珠单抗耐药相关。**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、resistance、pathway
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Juliette Roels ; Hamid Ghaedi ; Soren Muller ; Akshay T Krishnamurty ; Ramya Ganesan ; Priyanka BabuSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensThe use of immunotherapy in solid tumors has significantly improved the outcomes and quality of life for cancer patients. However, a substantial fraction of patients remain unresponsive, highlighting the urgent need to identify novel mechanisms of resistance to enhance immune-centric, chemo-free treatment regimens. In this study, we investigate associations with immunotherapy resistance by integrating RNAseq data from 2800 bladder cancer patients enrolled in the IMvigor trials, focusing on resistance to the anti-PD-L1 therapy atezolizumab, along with single-cell data from 200 patient samples and healthy donors. To expand the analysis to a massive collection of over 100M cells from hundreds of diverse single cell studies, we present Firmament, a newly developed method to efficiently identify cell populations that show enrichment for expression of gene signatures. Through these analyses, we identify the Hippo pathway as critically associated with immunotherapy resistance in bladder cancer and other solid tumors. Our findings indicate that Hippo dysregulation in stromal cells, rather than cancer cells, drives the high YAP/TAZ signal in these tumors. We specifically identify dysregulated Hippo signaling in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared to healthy donor fibroblasts. These insights will be important for developing novel therapeutic combinations to improve outcomes for patients with solid tumors treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

**2.** **GSE300988 急性髓系白血病中 CoREST、p300 和视黄酸信号通路之间的相互作用 [RNA-seq]**

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Mina M. Tayari ; Helena Gomes Dos Santos ; Sadat Dokaneheifard ; Monica Valencia ; Felipe Beckedorff ; Arigela Harikumar ; Justin M. Watts ; Philip A. Cole ; Ramin ShiekhattarSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensThe histone demethylase KDM1A (LSD1), a component of the CoREST corepressor complex, is highly expressed in hematologic malignancies and regulates hematopoietic differentiation. Despite its essential developmental role, LSD1 inhibition has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance retinoic acid (RA)-responsive gene expression in subsets of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we show that LSD1 physically interacts with RAR/RXR heterodimers at specific genomic loci, restricting chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activation of differentiation programs. Single-agent inhibition of LSD1 or HDACs promotes only partial differentiation. In contrast, Corin, a dual LSD1/CoREST inhibitor, synergizes with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to induce robust myeloid differentiation and apoptosis. Corin treatment increases H3K4me3 and H3K27ac at promoters of ATRA-responsive genes and disrupts CoREST–RAR/RXR complexes, enabling recruitment of the coactivator p300. This epigenetic switch facilitates transcriptional reprogramming essential for terminal differentiation. Our findings identify the functional antagonism between CoREST and p300 as a regulatory axis of RA signaling in AML. Targeting this mechanism with Corin and ATRA re-sensitizes non-APL AML cells to RA-induced differentiation, suggesting a broader therapeutic approach for overcoming resistance in ATRA-refractory leukemias.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Laura Gröger ; Shusruto Rishik ; Nicole Ludwig ; Amila Beganovic ; Marcus Koch ; Stefanie Rheinheimer ; Martin Hart ; Petra König ; Tabea Trampert ; Pascal Paul ; Annette Boese ; Claus-Michael Lehr ; Sören L. Becker ; Gregor Fuhrmann ; Andreas Keller ; Eckart MeeseSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensExtracellular vesicles (EVs), released by both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, have emerged as key mediators of cell-to-cell communication. Recent advances highlight their crucial role in cross-kingdom communication, bridging the microbial world with human biology. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying EV-mediated bidirectional communication within the gastrointestinal ecosystem. Using a model that includes human colon cells and both Gram-positive and Gram-negative gut bacteria, we reveal an intricate exchange of information between these kingdoms. Our analysis uncovered highly specific responses of host cells to bacterial EVs (BEVs) and BEV-RNA cargo, including uptake rates by human cells, impact on human cell viability, and alterations in their transcriptomic landscape. In parallel, we discovered that host-derived EVs and miR-192-5p are internalized by gut bacteria, leading to changes in their growth pattern. These findings highlight the precision with which EVs and their RNA cargo mediate interkingdom communication. Our results underscore the importance of tailored, context-specific analyses for understanding the scope of EV-mediated interactions in complex biological systems.

**6.** **GSE319750 ARID1A缺陷在弥漫型胃癌中促进嘧啶代谢脆弱性**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、metabolic
- 📝 **描述**：Contributor : Hideaki OgiwaraSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing ; Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensLoss-of-function mutations in ARID1A define an aggressive subtype of diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) that is often resistant to standard chemotherapy. Here, we uncover a precise metabolic vulnerability in ARID1A-deficient DGC driven by a specific transporter defect. Through integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses, we demonstrate that ARID1A loss transcriptionally represses the high-affinity nucleoside transporter SLC28A3. Our profiling revealed a critical lack of redundancy in the concentrative transporter family (CNT) in DGC, establishing a strict reliance on SLC28A3 for maintaining intracellular deoxycytidine (dC) pools. Consequently, ARID1A deficiency creates a severe "low-dCTP" metabolic bottleneck. We show that the dC analog Gemcitabine exploits this state through a distinct functional dichotomy: it enters via intact equilibrative transporters (ENTs) to target cells that have lost their competitive dC barrier. Mechanistically, Gemcitabine exerts a "dual-hit" effect by outcompeting the scarce dC pool for DNA incorporation while simultaneously inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, thereby blocking de novo nucleotide synthesis. This synergistic collapse of pyrimidine metabolism was validated in patient-derived ex vivo cultures and in vivo peritoneal dissemination models. Our findings provide a robust mechanistic basis for repurposing Gemcitabine as a precision therapy for ARID1A-deficient DGC, offering a potent strategy for this intractable malignancy.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：sequencing、ChIP-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : K C Rajan ; Stryder Meadows ; Maria J GalazoSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusPurpose: Zinc Finger MIZ-Type Containing 1 (Zmiz1) is a member of the PIAS family of protein and function as a transcriptional coactivator of Notch, Androgen Receptor (AR), p53, Estrogen Receptor (ER), and Smad3/4 . Here, we use Neuro-2a cell line to perform ChIP sequencing on Zmiz1 bound, direct or indirect to profile Zmiz1 associated genomic regulation.Methods: Neuro-2a (N2a) (ATCC, CCL-131) were cultured in DMEM-high glucose (Cytiva, SH30022) supplemented with 5 % FBS (Cytiva, SH3008803) and 50 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15070063) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Zmiz1-HA was overexpressed in N2a cells and subsequently, ChIP DNA samples were obtained by using ChIP-IT Express Enzymatic Kit (Active Motif, 53009) and processed according to manufacturer specifications. Anti-HA-Tag Antibody (Cell Signaling, 3724S) was used for immunoprecipitation. Pull down DNA quantity was measured using Qubit DNA HS kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q32851). The sequencing library was prepared using TruSeq ChIP Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, IP-202–1012). Ten nanograms of starting material were used for library preparation. Library quality and quantity were assessed using Agilent DNA 1000 chip (Agilent 5067-1504) and Qubit DNA HS kit respectively. Libraries were sequenced using the NextSeq1000/2000 P2 Reagents (200 Cycles) v3 (Illumina, 20046812) on a Nextseq1000/2000 system. Sequencing analysis was done using the ChIPSeq App from BaseSpace Labs (Illumina), which uses MACS2 for region enrichment and HOMER for motif analysis.Results: ChIP-seq peaks analysis identified thousands of peaks which are mostly located in intergenic regions followed by introns.Conclusions: We identify Zmiz1 bound DNA (direclty or indireclty) in Neuro-2a cells thus providing genomic regulation in neurodevelopmental events.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：regex:bacter(ia|ial|ium)、Alzheimer
- 📝 **描述**：A common bacterium best known for causing pneumonia and sinus infections may also play a surprising role in Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers found that Chlamydia pneumoniae can invade the retina and brain, where it sparks inflammation, nerve cell death, and the buildup of amyloid-beta—the hallmark protein linked to Alzheimer’s. Higher levels of the bacterium were found in people with Alzheimer’s, especially those carrying the high-risk APOE4 gene, and were tied to more severe cognitive decline.

In a sweeping study of nearly 28 million older Americans, researchers found that long term exposure to fine particle air pollution was linked to a higher likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s. The connection appeared to stem largely from pollution’s direct effects on the brain, rather than through related health conditions like hypertension or depression.

- 📝 **描述**：Exercise may sharpen the mind by repairing the brain’s protective shield. Researchers found that physical activity prompts the liver to release an enzyme that removes a harmful protein causing the blood-brain barrier to become leaky with age. In older mice, dialing down this protein reduced inflammation and improved memory. The discovery points to a surprising body-to-brain pathway that could inspire new Alzheimer’s therapies.
