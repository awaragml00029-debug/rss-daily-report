- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Nitin Narwade ; Raúl Jiménez-Castaño ; Khalil K Youssef ; Angela NietoSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Mus musculus ; synthetic constructDisseminated cancer cells rarely succeed in forming macrometastases, yet they continue to be the most life-threatening cause of patient mortality. The determinants driving metastatic competence, however, are still poorly understood. Using data from human breast cancer patients and genetic mouse models, we uncover a non-linear relationship between the expression of the EMT transcription factor Prrx1 in the primary tumor and metastatic outcome. Multi-omics analyses in mouse tumors reveal that Prrx1 functions as a dual regulator, promoting invasive behavior while simultaneously inducing dormancy. Cells with intermediate Prrx1 levels exhibit the highest metastatic fitness, whereas extreme levels (negative or too high) lead to less metastasis, typical of a hormetic behavior, and respectively due to insufficient invasiveness or to dormancy. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of dormancy and its link to metastatic potential. Additionally, we propose that combined signatures of invasion and proliferation allow robust prognosis prediction in breast cancer patients. Our study further highlights Prrx1-driven heterogeneity, established in the primary tumor, as a key determinant of metastatic competence.

We show that immunosuppression-mediated reactivation of lymphatic LTBI and the subsequent induction of progressive disease can be prevented by vaccination with BCG or recombinant BCG (BCG::ESAT-6-PE25SS (abbreviated to PE25) even in the absence of CD4+ T cells. Spatial transcriptomics, network analysis and bioinformatic reveal that anti-CD4-mediated immunosuppression is associated with and enhanced immune response at the edge of TB lesions within the infection-draining cervical lymph nodes.

**3.** ⭐ **GSE314556 层粘蛋白A/C维持基因组拓扑结构并调控病毒驱动的B细胞活化所必需的转录程序。[Hi-C]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：B cell、Hi-C、genome
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Lisa B Caruso ; Italo TemperaSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Homo sapiensLamin A/C is a crucial structural component of the nuclear lamina that influences chromatin organization and gene regulation. In this study, we demonstrate that lamin A/C is vital for maintaining higher-order genome organization and transcriptional programs that support EBV-driven B-cell activation. Loss of lamin A/C in a B-lymphoblastoid cell line caused significant three-dimensional reorganization of the genome, evidenced by the loss of long-range chromatin loops, an increase in short-range contacts, and redistribution of H3K9me2- marked heterochromatin. These structural disruptions were linked to widespread changes in gene expression affecting metabolic, signaling, and differentiation pathways. Mechanistically, lamin A/C influences the nuclear positioning and transcription of CTCF-bound loci by preventing their relocation to the periphery and their association with lamin B1. Blocking H3K9me2 deposition mimicked the transcriptional effects of lamin A/C depletion and revealed increased sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors. Overall, our results identify lamin A/C as a key organizer of genome structure and epigenetic regulation in EBV-infected B cells, uncovering a lamin-dependent pathway that connects nuclear architecture, metabolism, and viral disease processes.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：spatial、spatial transcriptomics、transcriptomics
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Haoyan Jin ; Lingkai ZhangSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Bos taurusMammalian spermatogenesis is critical for the transmission of male genetic information, and single-cell sequencing technology can reveal its complex process. However, at present, there is no research on the dynamic transcription of bovine germ cell population. In this study, we used Stereo-seq to construct a spatial transcription map of bovine testicular tissue at two ages. Four germ cell groups and five somatic cell groups were determined, and functional enrichment characterized their different biological functions and the differences between calves and adult bovines. At the same time, we also defined the subpopulations of cells and marker genes, then, clarified the communications between germ cells. These data laid the foundation for the study of spermatogenesis in large mammals and elucidated the process of transcriptional changes for the mechanism of male germ cells.

**7.** ⭐ **GSE285389 将组蛋白 H2B 变体整合到染色质中可改变染色质可及性，从而诱导乳腺癌中上皮间质转化 [ATAC-seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、ATAC-seq、histone
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Hejer Dhahri ; Kin LauSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensHistones scaffold genomic DNA and regulate access to the transcriptional machinery. However, naturally occurring histone variants can alter histone-DNA interactions, DNA and histone modifications, and the chromatin interactome. Hence, alterations in histone variant deposition can disrupt chromatin, and are increasingly recognized as a way to trigger various disease (including cancer). While significant attention has been placed on the biochemical and functional roles of H2A and H3 variants, H2B variants remain largely understudied. Here, we show that H2B variants are dysregulated in breast cancer and that certain variants are associated with specific breast cancer subtypes. HIST1H2BO overexpression (in particular) is more common in Asian, African American/Black, and young female populations and is associated with a worse prognosis. In vitro, H2B1O compacts chromatin, and incorporating H2B1O into chromatin activates pro-inflammatory and oncogenic pathways and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and generates resistance to first-line chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, H2B1O acts much like an onco-histone, with H2B variant expression being a prognostic biomarker for breast cancer and a potential new target for drug therapies to enhance treatment efficacy.

**8.** ⭐ **GSE284679 靶向 PKMYT1 可增强去势抵抗性前列腺癌的抗肿瘤免疫反应 [scRNA-seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、immune、scRNA
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Lin Gao ; Bo Han ; Jing HuSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusAlthough immunotherapy has been successful in various tumors, its efficacy in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is minimal, due to reduced presence of intratumoral immune effector cells in CRPC. How CRPC cells escape immune surveillance is not fully defined. Here we demonstrate that PKMYT1 expression is elevated in CRPC cases, which related to low immune infiltration in these patients. Patients with high PKMYT1 expression exhibit low CD8+ T cells signature and resistance to ICB therapy. Targeting PKMYT1 can suppress CRPC progression, accompanied with increased intratumoral CD8+ T cells. Selective PKMYT1 inhibitor, RP-6306, augmented ICB in a manner dependent on CD8+ T cells. PKMYT1 inhibitors alone or in combination with PD-L1 blockade causes CD8+ T cell infiltration and remarkable tumor suppression, which suggests a promising immunotherapeutic approach in CRPC. Mechanically, targeting PKMYT1 activated the cGAS-STING pathway, which increases expression of type I and II interferon response genes and led to upregulation of key immune regulators. These findings highlight a key role of PKMYT1 in CRPC progression and rationalize PKMYT1 as a potential therapeutic target.

**9.** ⭐ **GSE272303 α-突触核蛋白病转基因小鼠模型的空间转录组成像**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：spatial、spatial transcriptomics、transcriptomics
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Liam Horan-Portelance ; Michiyo Iba ; Dominic J Acri ; J R Gibbs ; Mark R CooksonSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Mus musculusOne of the unifying pathological hallmarks of the age-related neurodegenerative disorders Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the presence of misfolded, aggregated, and often phosphorylated forms of the protein α-synuclein (α-syn) in neurons. α-syn pathology appears in select populations of neurons throughout various cortical and subcortical regions, and little is currently known about why some neurons develop pathology while others are spared. Here, we utilized subcellular-resolution imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (IST) in a transgenic mouse model which overexpresses wild-type human α-syn (α-syn-tg) to evaluate patterns of selective neuronal vulnerability to α-syn pathology. By performing post-run immunofluorescence for α-syn phosphorylated at Ser129 (pSyn), we identified cell types in the cortex and hippocampus of these mice which were vulnerable or resistant to developing pSyn pathology. Next, using a set of custom probes to detect genes involved in α-syn processing and toxicity, we investigated the transcriptional underpinnings of the observed selective vulnerability; this pointed to expression of the kinase-substrate pair Plk2, which phosphorylates α-syn at Ser129, and human SNCA (hSNCA), as a driving mechanistic force behind these neurons’ selective vulnerability to pSyn pathology in this model. Finally, we performed differential gene expression analysis, comparing non-transgenic cells to pSyn- and pSyn+ α-syn-tg cells; this revealed gene expression changes downstream of hSNCA overexpression and pSyn pathology which were conserved across cell types, including some genes which were differentially expressed in a pSyn-specific manner. This study provides one of the most comprehensive use cases of newly developed IST to date, yielding new biological insights into the formation of α-syn pathology and its downstream effects in a PD/DLB mouse model.

**10.** ⭐ **GSE254444 利用单细胞转录组学研究冯·希佩尔-林道综合征相关肾癌的肿瘤异质性**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、cancer、transcriptomics
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Isaline Rowe ; Giulia Scotti ; Giovanni Pipitone ; Andrea SaloniaSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensVon Hippel-Lindau (VHL) dìsease is a rare inherited disorder caused by the loss of the VHL gene and characterized by benign and malignant tumors in several organs. Patients with VHL disease have risk of developing multiple primary clear cell renal carcinomas (ccRCC). Patients are managed with multiple sessions of renal surgery causing renal failure and complication of dialysis or systemic progression and cancer-specific mortality. Our hypothesis states that multiple independent tumors from one VHL patient may display inter-tumoral heterogeneity characterized by differences in tumor grade, metabolic, stromal, and immune cell features that may cause different response to systemic therapy. We took advantage of a nephrectomy from one VHL patient to investigate molecular and microenvironmental factors in five independent primary tumors.
