- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Marco Campisi ; Talal El Zarif ; Jacob E Berchuck ; Zhaorong Li ; Matthew Freedman ; Michael Y Tolstorukov ; David A Barbie ; Navin R MahadevanSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) typically displays a "cold" tumor microenvironment with a paucity of immune infiltrate. Neuroendocrine SCLC cells also profoundly repress MHC-I expression, rendering them vulnerable to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Here, we confirm that neuroendocrine SCLC cells are sensitive to NK cell mediated attack, yet quantitative spatial profiling of the SCLC immune microenvironment in patient samples reveals that effector immune cells, including NK cells, are excluded from MHC-Ilow/neg SCLC regions. To study this biology, we develop dynamic single cell RNA sequencing of microphysiological immune tumor environments (DynaMITE-seq) and integrate findings with spatial transcriptomics in patient tissue, unveiling the microvasculature as a major checkpoint restricting NK cell extravasation/recruitment. We demonstrate that activation of vascular Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) signaling restores NK cell infiltration and killing of neuroendocrine SCLC, suggesting a strategy to overcome this key SCLC immunologic barrier and prime therapeutic response to DLL3-targeted CAR-NK cell therapy.

An increasingly important task with these data has become the transfer of cell type or spatial domain annotations from a given reference (or source) atlas into a new target tissue or sample. The reference and target datasets could be at different resolutions or measured on different experimental platforms. Here, we present a method to perform cross-platform transfer learning that takes as input single-cell or spatial domain labels from a reference atlas or dataset and transfers the labels to a target dataset at a similar or different resolution. Specifically, we use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on the reference data to identify factors associated with labels of interest and project these factors into the target dataset to label each new observation. We use a multinomial model with the factors as covariates and labels as the response to predict labels in the target dataset. In contrast to existing approaches, the advantage of our approach is interpretability, without compromising on accuracy. We demonstrate the performance of the method in two human brain tissues and show that our model identifies spatially coherent domains in the target datasets with concordance of marker gene expression. We implement spaTransfer in open-source software as an R package (github.com/cindyfang70/spaTransfer).

**5.** ⭐ **GSE283333 全面免疫分析揭示 IFN-γ 信号通路在 T 细胞介导啮齿动物疟疾模型中的寄生虫吞噬作用：空间转录组学数据**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：immune、spatial、spatial transcriptomics、transcriptomics
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Jingwen Lin ; Shasha Chen ; Qingxin YangSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Mus musculusMalaria-associated lung pathology, a severe and life-threatening manifestation of Plasmodium infection, involves complex immune remodeling within the pulmonary microenvironment. To resolve the spatial architecture of this immune response, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis on lung tissues from a Plasmodium berghei NK65-induced rodent model. Our study identifies IFN-γ signaling in T cells as a pivotal regulator of the lung's spatial immune landscape. By utilizing conditional knockout (cKO) mice lacking Ifngr1 specifically in T cells, we observed that the blockade of T cell-intrinsic IFN-γ signaling attenuates lung pathology. Spatially, this protection is characterized by an enriched colocalization and enhanced interaction between T cells and monocytes. This robust interaction drives the expansion of a unique proinflammatory monocyte subset defined by CD8 and Ly6C expression within specific pulmonary niches. These CD8+ Ly6C+ monocytes exhibit significantly enhanced phagocytic capacity and elevated MHCII expression in situ. Our spatially resolved findings illustrate that the T cell-IFN-γ signaling axis dictates the spatial organization of T cell-monocyte communication, highlighting this interaction as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating malaria-induced lung injury.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Thomas J Kalantzakos ; Yufan Zhou ; Xingyu Liu ; Joshua Proehl ; Cameron Durfee ; Ian Tamayo ; Nuri Temiz ; Benjamin Troness ; Anusha Soni ; Harshita B Gupta ; Reuben S HarrisSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusBreast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis in women. Clinical studies with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are encouraging for immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy (aPD-1 with paclitaxel and/or carboplatin). However, additional clinical advances may be pursued more rapidly with assistance from preclinical TNBC models including syngeneic mammary tumor cell lines. Here, we report two mammary tumor cell lines that exhibit differential responsiveness to immunotherapy in vivo. Spontaneous mammary tumors from C57BL/6J MMTV-Cre Trp53fl/+ animals were passaged serially in cell culture and in vivo in the mammary fat pad of fully wildtype animals. The resulting lines, MM001i and MM008i, lost Trp53 and formed 1000 mm3 tumors in the mammary fat pad within 21-28 days. Despite originating from the same genetic background, these lines exhibit differential responses to immunotherapy. For aPD-1 therapy, MM001i is poorly responsive and MM008i is strongly responsive with near-complete tumor regression. In comparison, both MM001i and MM008i respond rapidly to aCTLA-4 therapy. Both models express unique tumor antigens as evidenced by immunity to subsequent engraftments. Primary MM008i tumors exhibit greater T cell infiltration, and CD8-positive T lymphocytes are required for aPD-1 responses. These TNBC models are promising for further mechanistic studies and testing future single and combinatorial therapies.

**7.** ⭐ **GSE307584 组胺 N-甲基转移酶异常上调通过破坏 SAM/Frizzled-2/CaMKII 信号通路加剧病理性心脏肥大和心力衰竭 [RNA-seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cardiac、RNA-seq、pathway
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Jinyan Zhang ; Hao Jiang ; Liwei Liu ; Xin Li ; Jing Yang ; Junbo Ge ; Aijun SunSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusMetabolites produced during the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure can influence disease progression. Methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) levels are decreased in the hypertrophic heart, but related mechanisms and effects remain unknown. Histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) uses SAM as a substrate to deactivate histamine into N-methylhistamine. Here, we prove that HNMT was upregulated in cardiac tissues from patients with heart failure and post-transverse aortic constriction (TAC) mice as well as phenylephrine (PE)-treated neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes (NMCMs). N-methylhistamine, downstream metabolite of HNMT, was elevated in urine samples from heart failure patients. In mice, cardiomyocyte-specific Hnmt deletion ameliorated pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure caused by TAC or Angiotensin-II infusion. Pharmacological inhibition of HNMT with amodiaquine ameliorated TAC-induced cardiac dysfunction. In contrast, cardiomyocyte-specific Hnmt overexpression caused cardiac dysfunction. Mechanistically, HNMT decreased intracellular SAM levels and interacted with enhancer of zeste homolog2 (EZH2). This interaction blocked EZH2 function and downregulated H3K27me3 modification at the Frizzled-2 (Fzd2) promoter, which increased Fzd2 expression. FZD2 upregulation activated the calcium/calcium–calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) pathway, which mediated the pro-hypertrophic effects of HNMT. This study identified HNMT as a promising therapeutic target for treating pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

This study provides a transcriptome-wide characterization of how physiological gut microbiota regulate the expression of intestinal transporters, phase I and phase II metabolic enzymes, and barrier machinery relevant to oral drug disposition. By identifying microbiota-responsive processes, this work defines the scope of inter-individual variability attributable to gut microbial effects.

**9.** ⭐ **GSE316867 静止胶质母细胞瘤活化和免疫逃逸的代谢许可通过星形胶质细胞-线粒体穿梭 [RNA-Seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：immune、metabolic、RNA-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Hongrui Zhu ; Li Wang ; Qingsong HuSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensThe reaction of quiescent tumor cell subpopulations at the invasive margin of glioblastoma (GBM) might be cleared by immune surveillance toward death or expand through immune escape, which can drive therapeutic resistance, tumor dissemination, and recurrence through phenotypic plasticity. However, the process and mechanisms underlying their activation remain largely unclear. This study revealed that astrocytes awaken quiescent GBM cells to cycling and immune-evasive phenotypes. Astrocytic mitochondria are indispensable in regulating the phenotypic changes. Specifically, the SHMT2 enzyme in astrocytic mitochondria catalyzes one-carbon metabolic products, which significantly promote synthetic metabolic activation and reactivation of quiescent GBM cells to immune evasion through intercellular mitochondrial transfer. Tumor cells that acquire astrocytic mitochondria enhanced one-carbon metabolism drives global hyperactive anabolic metabolism through YTHDC1-mediated transcriptional pause release of ribosomal and focal adhesion signaling genes, supporting rapid proliferation and conferring a potent immune-evasive phenotype. Therapeutically, pharmacologic or genetic inhibiting the astrocytic SHMT2 or blocking mitochondrial transfer markedly suppressed quiescent GBM cell activation and tumor progression. These findings elucidate a novel mechanism by which astrocytes in the tumor microenvironment drive GBM malignancy through metabolic symbiosis.

- 📝 **描述**：Series Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensOur study demonstrates that combined treatment with the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat and the KRAS inhibitor RMC-6236 markedly activates the expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes in pancreatic cancer, thereby enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of RMC-6236 and potentially providing a strategy to overcome resistance to KRAS inhibition. To characterize the epigenetic features underlying SASP gene activation, H3K27ac ChIP-seq was performed in PSN1 cells treated with DMSO, tazemetostat, RMC-6236, or the combination of both inhibitors.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer
- 📝 **描述**：Researchers have discovered how pancreatic cancer reprograms its surroundings to spread quickly and stealthily. By using a protein called periostin, the tumor remodels nearby tissue and invades nerves, which helps cancer cells travel and form metastases. This process also creates a tough, fibrous barrier that makes treatments less effective. Targeting periostin could help stop this invasion before it starts.
