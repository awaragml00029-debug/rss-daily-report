**2.** ⭐ **GSE305350 CD27激动剂增强长效CD4⁺ T细胞疫苗反应，这对2种抗肿瘤免疫至关重要**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、immunity、vaccine、T cell
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Zachary C Hartman ; Bin-Jin Hwang ; David T Severson ; Erika J CrosbySeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing ; OtherOrganism : Mus musculusPatients with metastatic breast cancer were vaccinated with dendritic cell (DC) vaccine targeting HER2, and all seven survived >18 years. PBMC analysis revealed HER2-specific CD27⁺ memory CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, suggesting that CD27 signaling supports durable immune memory. We tested this by combining an anti-CD27 agonist antibody (Varlilumab) with a HER2 vaccine, which enhanced HER2-specific responses, particularly long-lived CD4⁺ memory T cells detectable up to 300 days post-vaccination. CD27 agonism improved tumor control (~40% regression) compared to vaccine alone (~6%), and synergy with PD-1 blockade led to complete tumor rejection in ~90% of mice. CD4⁺ T cells were essential for this effect, as shown by depletion and adoptive transfer experiments, while CD8⁺ T cells played a less critical role. We utilized combined scRNA-seq and TCR sequencing to identify expanded clonotypes and increased CD8+ and CD4+ functional subsets with combined CD27 agonism and vaccination as well as vaccination alone. These findings demonstrate that antigen-specific huCD27⁺ CD4⁺ T cells are key effectors of vaccine-induced immunity and support CD27 agonism as a promising strategy to enhance therapeutic cancer vaccination.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、cancer、immune、single-cell
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Jie Huang ; Zhenhua Zhang ; Guodi Cai ; Junjian WangSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensBackground The transformation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recognized treatment resistance mechanism, most often arising from EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, the underlying mechanisms of transformation remain poorly understood. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing was employed to analyze the tumor cell heterogeneity and to map the intratumoral immune cell landscape of 73,195 cells from five LUAD, three transformed small cell lung cancer (T-SCLC) and four SCLC patients. Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) staining and in vitro studies were further conducted to validate the stem-like feature of a malignant cell cluster and the enrichment and the function of interferon-stimulated gene-positive (ISG+) lymphocytes in transformation. Results Although increased intratumoral heterogeneity was observed upon SCLC transformation, a stem-like malignant cell subpopulation was identified to recur across subtypes and groups as the pioneering force of lineage plasticity for SCLC transformation. Further mIF staining and transcription factor analysis validated the stem-like feature. Additionally, tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) analysis revealed that ISG+ T cells and B cells were enriched in T-SCLC. Further cell co-culture analyses disclosed that ISG+ lymphocytes promoted neuroendocrine differentiation in LUAD cells via type I interferons (IFN-Is). Deciphering cell-cell interactions revealed that the stem-like malignant cells might activate and attract ISG+ T cells. Finally, we developed an ISG-associated gene signature that significantly correlates with poor prognosis in LUAD. Conclusion Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the lineage plasticity and the immune landscape in T-SCLC, highlighting the crucial role of the stem-like cell cluster and ISG+ lymphocytes in LUAD-to-SCLC transformation.

**4.** ⭐ **GSE301741 单细胞分析突显了恶性细胞 IFN/MHC-II 在头颈部鳞状细胞癌免疫治疗反应中的重要性**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：carcinoma、MHC、regex:immuno(logy|therapy|suppression)
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Michael Mints ; Reilly A Sample ; Anuraag S Parikh ; Jesse M Zaretsky ; Itay Tirosh ; Sidharth V PuramSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensFor many cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), response rates to immunotherapy remain modest, with limited ability to predict responders. Previous studies that characterized cellular changes associated with immunotherapy in HNSCC focused on immune cells, providing limited insight into malignant cell responses. Motivated by this gap, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on 16 HNSCC patients pre- and post-neoadjuvant pembrolizumab treatment. We identified a malignant-interferon (IFN)/MHC-II program in malignant cells, characterized by expression of MHC-II and interferon response genes, which was associated with tumor response to pembrolizumab. We validated malignant cell MHC-II expression at the protein level and characterized its relationship with surrounding immune subsets via multiplexed immunofluorescence. In a murine HNSCC model, IFN-γ-induced malignant cell MHC-II expression marked tumors with favorable immune microenvironments and sensitivity to immunotherapy. Finally, we confirmed pre-treatment expression of the malignant-IFN/MHC-II program as marker of response through deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data from an independent cohort of 25 pembrolizumab-treated HNSCC patients. Beyond identifying malignant cell MHC-II expression and the malignant-IFN/MHC-II program as potential biomarkers for immunotherapy response in HNSCC, our work provides additional insights into the specific and important role of malignant cells in immunotherapy.

**5.** ⭐ **GSE318768 HPV相关DNA甲基化改变在时空上塑造头颈部肿瘤微环境**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、tumor microenvironment、methylation
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Sabrina Wurzba ; Mariana MaschiettoSeries Type : Methylation profiling by genome tiling arrayOrganism : Homo sapiensThis study explores DNA methylation profile and their impact on tumor microenvironment (TME) of head and neck cancer (HNC). By integrating advanced high-throughput platforms, including Human Methylation 450K BeadChip microarrays and single-cell imaging mass cytometry (IMC), we identified distinct methylation signatures and immune landscapes in HNC associated with HPV-positive vs. HPV-negative tumors. Differentially methylated sites between HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors showed enrichment for immune system regulatory pathways, with marked signatures of T lymphocyte regulation. To better understand the relationship between DNA methylation and tumor microenvironment regulation, we sought to evaluate the immunological components from a spatial perspective and observed that in HPV-positive tumors, T lymphocytes appear to activate a self-regulatory mechanism, while in HPV-negative tumors this mechanism is blocked by the action of fibroblasts, which are the cells that interact most with T lymphocytes. The spatial dynamics within the TME regulated by epigenetic mechanisms pave the way for more precise clinical decision-making and personalized therapies for HNC patients.

**6.** ⭐ **GSE289349 脑膜瘤微环境蕴含丰富的免疫图谱，具有治疗意义（单细胞 RNA 测序部分）**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：immune、RNA-seq、single-cell
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Wenya Linda Bi ; Xiaopeng Guo ; Joseph DriverSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensEffective therapeutic targets are urgently needed for aggressive meningiomas. Given the pivotal role of immune microenvironment in tumor progression, we developed a comprehensive atlas of the meningioma microenvironment. Using single-cell and bulk techniques, we revealed a rich immune infiltrate in 2,610 meningiomas, among the highest observed across 34 human cancer types. Macrophages predominated in meningioma, contrasting with the lymphoid dominance of peripheral blood, with meninges exhibiting an intermediate immune profile. Cellular states and phenotypes of both immune and tumor cells shift during tumor progression toward an earlier-stage immune-suppressive and proliferative profile in aggressive meningiomas. Using ex vivo patient-derived tumor organoids, we demonstrated inducible responses to STING activation, marked by elevated cytokine release, which were synergistic when combined with PD-1 blockade. Together, these findings provide an extensive resource on the cellular heterogeneity of the meningioma microenvironment and provide a framework for rational therapeutic modeling and strategy development.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、resistance
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Bangwei Fang ; Yao ZhuSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains a lethal disease with limited treatment options following resistance to AR signaling inhibitors. Despite the known roles of EGFR and HER3 in prostate cancer progression, prior therapies targeting this pathway have failed clinically. In this study, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of BL-B01D1, a bispecific antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) targeting EGFR and HER3, in prostate cancer models. BL-B01D1 exhibited potent, target-dependent cytotoxicity across prostate cancer cell lines, xenografts, and patient-derived organoids. Mechanistically, we identified ABCG2 upregulation as a driver of acquired resistance, and pharmacological inhibition of ABCG2 restored drug sensitivity. These findings establish BL-B01D1 as a promising therapeutic strategy in mCRPC and nominate ABCG2 as a potential combination target to overcome resistance.

**9.** **GSE291247 DLEU2 通过 E2F1 的相互正反馈激活促进宫颈鳞状细胞癌的细胞运动和免疫浸润**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：carcinoma、immune
- 📝 **描述**：Contributor : Min HeSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensCancer metastasis is the primary cause of high mortality in patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC). The invasive ability of cancer cells is enhanced by increased cell motility, which contributes to their distant metastasis. The oncogenic lncRNA DLEU2, implicated in tumor progression and prognosis, remains understudied in CESC. This study investigated how DLEU2 enhances cell motility and regulates immune infiltration in CESC. We found that DLEU2 was upregulated in CESC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis in advanced-stage patients. Functionally, DLEU2 knockdown suppressed cell migration and invasion, while its overexpression enhanced motility. Mechanistically, DLEU2 knockdown altered the expression of downstream genes related to cell motility and adhesion. An interaction between DLEU2 and E2F1 protein was confirmed by RNA pulldown assay. E2F1 expression was downregulated or upregulated after DLEU2 knockdown or overexpression, respectively, while DLEU2 expression was also upregulated after E2F1 overexpression. Therefore, DLEU2 may form a regulatory loop with E2F1 to activate the transcription of downstream genes related to cell motility and adhesion. Additionally, E2F1 expression strongly correlated with immune infiltration levels (e.g., T cells, Tregs, monocytes, mast cells), and DLEU2 exhibited a parallel immune cell abundance pattern, suggesting indirect immunomodulatory effects via E2F1. These findings propose that the DLEU2-E2F1 axis promotes CESC metastasis by dual mechanisms: enhancing tumor cell motility and reshaping the immune microenvironment. The study highlights DLEU2 as a potential therapeutic target to disrupt metastatic pathways and immune evasion in CESC. Further validation is needed to explore clinical applications of targeting this regulatory network.

**10.** **GSE290273 KLF5 调控表观遗传修饰，驱动人类胰腺导管腺癌转移 [RNA-Seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：RNA-seq、epigenetic
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Masahiro Maeda ; Weqiang Zhou ; Kenna Sherman ; Andrew P FeinbergSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensWe previously showed that distant metastases of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are driven by epigenetic alterations in the primary tumor rather than by additional mutations1. However, the specific epigenetic driver genes responsible have not been identified. To identify genes modulating these changes, we performed a pooled CRISPR genetic screen and single-cell multiomics analysis using patient-derived xenograft cell lines established from a primary PDAC tumor and a distant metastasis from the same patient. We identified KLF5 as the leading epigenetic modulator regulating progression in distant metastasis. Knockdown of KLF5 selectively reduced the growth of the distant metastasis and caused a large-scale increase in heterochromatin. Single-cell multiome ATAC and gene expression analysis revealed two clusters with high KLF5 expression and increased expression and chromatin accessibility of stem cell markers and genes related to migration and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Further, we identified two epigenetic modifiers, NCAPD2 and MTHFD1, which are regulated by KLF5 and result in these increases in heterochromatin when knocked down. These data provide a sequence of epigenetic modulators, modifiers and mediators which shape the metastatic landscape of pancreatic cancer.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、immune
- 📝 **描述**：Scientists have uncovered a surprising way tumors turn the immune system to their advantage. Researchers at the University of Geneva found that neutrophils—normally frontline defenders against infection—can be reprogrammed inside tumors to fuel cancer growth instead. Once exposed to the tumor environment, these immune cells begin producing a molecule called CCL3 that actively promotes tumor progression.
