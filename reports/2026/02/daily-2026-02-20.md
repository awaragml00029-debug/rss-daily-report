- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Natalie Wu ; Richard LuSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Homo sapiensNeuroblastoma, a deadly pediatric cancer from the sympathetic ganglia of the peripheral nervous system, frequently metastasizes, driving poor outcomes in high-risk cases. While primary tumors are well-characterized, the cellular and molecular dynamics of metastasis remain poorly understood. Here, we employed single-cell multi-omics and spatial transcriptomics to profile lymph node metastases in high-risk neuroblastoma compared to primary adrenal masses. We found that lymph node metastases displayed unique cellular heterogeneity and plasticity marked by a shift toward mesenchymal-like and cancer stem cell states, with enriched epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programs. Lymph node metastatic niche exhibited altered tumor microenvironment dynamics, characterized by increased immunosuppressive myeloid subsets, heightened immune checkpoint signaling and lymphocyte exhaustion, indicative of immune evasion and dysfunction. Our multi-omics studies reveal distinct features of high-risk neuroblastoma that contribute to metastasis and therapy resistance, pointing to potential therapeutic vulnerabilities of the aggressive metastatic disease.

**2.** ⭐ **GSE294509 ALOX15B 低表达通过 TAP1/MHC-I 轴调节弥漫性大 B 细胞淋巴瘤中的免疫抑制性肿瘤微环境**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、lymphoma、tumor microenvironment、B cell、MHC
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Lanxin Zhang ; Yucui ShangSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusThe arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism is closely related to tumor immune evasion and chemo-resistance. ALOX15B (arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase type B), located on chromosome 17p, encodes a key enzyme in AA pathway. Interestingly, the expression of ALOX15B is independent of 17p status but is epigenetically regulated. Low ALOX15B expression predicts poor prognosis, with PGE2 activation and TAP1 suppression, reducing MHC-I expression and creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Tucidinostat, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, restores ALOX15B and enhances the TAP1/MHC-I axis, thus promoting lymphoma cell apoptosis, which correlates with the effect of tucidinostat plus immunochemotherapy in a phase II trial of patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL (NCT02753647). Our study provides insight into a novel therapeutic strategy to improve patient prognosis by epigenetically modulating lymphoma metabolism and optimizing the tumor microenvironment.

The mechanisms underlying SAP-induced intestinal injury remain unclear, particularly regarding spatial cellular reorganization and functional interactions. Methods This study constructed a severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) rat model and employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptome sequencing (stRNA-seq) technologies to systematically analyze the dynamic changes in intestinal cellular composition, spatial distribution, and function during SAP-induced intestinal injury. Results snRNA-seq identified 18 major ileal cell populations spanning epithelial, immune, stem/TA, and stromal compartments. SAP was associated with compositional remodeling characterized by downward trends in Lgr5⁺/Olfm4⁺ stem cells, TA1, goblet cells, and Paneth cells, with a reciprocal increase in enterocytes, although most proportion changes did not reach statistical significance at the animal level. Spatial transcriptomics independently captured SAP-associated tissue remodeling, including a significant reduction in Paneth cells accompanied by increases in fat cells, macrophages, goblet cells, and TA2 cells. Across epithelial lineages, SAP induced a transcriptional shift toward immune interaction with up-regulation of antigen presentation–related genes (e.g., Cd74, Apoa1) and down-regulation of antimicrobial/barrier effectors (e.g., Defa24, Pla2g2a, Dmbt1), which was corroborated by spatial expression patterns and spatially variable gene programs enriched for host defense responses. Pseudotime analysis suggested a redistribution of epithelial states along the stem/TA-to-enterocyte continuum, with relative depletion of early states and expansion of enterocyte-dominant states in SAP. CellChat analysis revealed globally intensified intercellular communication and nominated FN1 as the pathway with the highest differential information flow, with Lgr5⁺ stem cells predicted as prominent FN1 senders targeting enterocytes and smooth muscle cells. SCENIC identified reduced activity and expression of Hmga2/Myb regulons in stem compartments, and immunofluorescence showed decreasing trends in Hmga2/Myb-positive Olfm4⁺ and Lgr5⁺ stem cells in SAP.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Haiyin Li ; Yeqing Chen ; Jessica Kaster ; Maggie Dunne ; Min Xiao ; Ling Li ; Monzy Thomas ; Nazifa Promi ; Dylan Fingerman ; Gregory S Brown ; Xingyue Zhu ; Meenhard HerlynSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensMost advanced cancers initially respond to targeted therapies but eventually relapse1. Rather than acquiring new mutations, resistance is driven by drug-tolerant persister cells (DTP) that enter a reversible drug-refractory state and sustain minimal residual disease2. Here, we developed MeRLin, a high-resolution barcoding platform combining single-cell RNA sequencing, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, and computational analyses to track clonal and transcriptional dynamics of melanoma cells during targeted therapy. Clonal tracking reveals that dominant resistant clones arise from minor pre-treatment subpopulations. The pre-treatment melanoma populations diversify into phenotypically distinct DTP subpopulations, marked by stress-like, lipid metabolism, PI3K signaling, and extracellular matrix remodeling programs associated with adaptive resistance. Spatial transcriptomics revealed the co-localization of lipid metabolism and PI3K signaling programs near the tumor boundaries, and a complex network of autocrine and paracrine interactions among DTP subpopulations. Using barcoded RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, we identified a dominant persister subpopulation in resistant tumors marked by SLC2A1 expression. Thus, MeRLin provides a robust framework to dissect melanoma heterogeneity and uncover vulnerabilities in persister populations to improve long-term treatment efficacy.

**10.** ⭐ **GSE294261 阿尔茨海默病小鼠模型的多组学单核分析表明 ACSS2 赋予神经元抵抗 tau 蛋白病变的能力 [RNA-Seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：Alzheimer、Neuronal、RNA-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Gabor Egervari ; Desi Alexander ; Hua Huang ; Greg Donahue ; Connor Hogan ; Mariel Mendoza ; Hong Xu ; Virginia Lee ; Ben A Garcia ; Nancy M Bonini ; Shelley L BergerSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusLoss of cell identity and global epigenomic dysregulation are emerging as key contributors to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The mechanisms by which protective or risk-conferring epigenetic marks are established and maintained are under intense investigation. ACSS2 (Acetyl-CoA Synthetase 2) is a key metabolic enzyme that is nuclear-localized in neurons. In healthy brains, ACSS2 fuels histone acetylation and drives expression of neuronal genes that regulate learning and memory. Here, we examine how loss of ACSS2 contributes to AD-associated cellular, genomic and behavioral outcomes, focusing on long-term steady state changes. Using a mouse model of human pathological AD-Tau injection, we show that loss of ACSS2 exacerbates Tau-related memory impairments, while dietary supplementation of acetate rescues learning in an ACSS2-dependent manner. Combining state-of-the-art proteomic and genomic approaches, we demonstrate that this effect is accompanied by ACSS2-dependent incorporation of acetate into hippocampal histone acetylation, which facilitates gene expression programs related to learning. We identify the most severely affected hippocampal neuronal populations, including pyramidal cells of the perforant pathway and Cajal-Retzius cells. Overall, these results reveal ACSS2 as a neuroprotective metabolic enzyme in key hippocampal neuronal populations, and dysregulation of which may play an important role in the etiology of AD. These findings may guide development of future therapies for AD, other tauopathies and related dementia.

By repositioning a small fragment of an HPV protein on a DNA-based nanovaccine, the team dramatically strengthened the immune system’s attack on HPV-driven tumors. One specific design slowed tumor growth, extended survival in animal models, and unleashed far more cancer-killing T cells than other versions made with the exact same components.
