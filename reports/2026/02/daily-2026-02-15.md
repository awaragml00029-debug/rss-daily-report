Here, we show that targeting the epigenetic factor DNA methyltransferase 1 in endothelial cells (ECs) results in reduced angiogenesis while imparting profound changes to the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), including increased proportions of CD4+ memory T-cells and NK cells. Depleting CD4+ T-cells, or blocking lymphocyte egress from the lymph nodes with FTY720, rescues tumor growth in mice with conditional deletion of Dnmt1 in ECs (Dnmt1iECKO) and dramatically shortens overall survival, whereas NK cells are dispensable. Tumors implanted in Dnmt1iECKO mice show reduced vascular branching, elevated expression of Vcam1, increased vessel-associated T-cells, and a shift in vascular specification including increased proportions of immune-permissive post-capillary venules (PCVs) and interferon-stimulated ECs (IFN_x0002_ECs). Deleting Dnmt1 in EC cultures strikingly potentiates responses to combinations of IFNg and TNFa and, notably, up-regulates important T-cell co-stimulatory molecules for memory CD4+ T-cells, including Icosl, Cd40, and Tnfsf4. Finally, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) administered to Dnmt1iECKO mice with experimental melanoma lung metastasis reduces tumor burden, with some mice showing tumor eradication. Our findings identify endothelial Dnmt1 as a key regulator of vascular-mediated anti-tumor immunity, providing a rationale for integrating epigenetic modulation of the vasculature with cancer immunotherapy regimens.

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、lymph、T cell、regex:lymph(o|atic)?
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Yang Zhang ; Haiquan ChenSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensCurrent surgical guidelines overlook preserving uninvolved lymph nodes (uiLNs) in non-small cell lung cancer, principally stemming from an underappreciation of their critical role in anti-tumor immunity. Here, we discovered a significant immunosuppressive microenvironment in metastatic lymph nodes. In contrast, CD200+ progenitor exhausted T cells (Tpex) markedly expanded within uiLNs following immunotherapy. Effective clonal sharing of exhausted T cells between uiLNs and tumors correlated strongly with complete pathological response. Previously unrecognized tumor-resident C1QA+ dendritic cells secreted CXCL9, facilitating T cell recruitment, whereas fibroblast-enriched neighborhoods in non-responders created immunosuppressive barriers hindering CXCL9 diffusion and CD200+ Tpex migration. Finally, we confirmed that tumor-reactive Tex clones from uiLNs could persist systemically and identified two neoantigen peptides as direct targets of these tumor-reactive Tex cells. Our study unprecedentedly elucidates the spatiotemporal dynamics of immunotherapy-responsive T cell subsets in LN-tumor axis and provides compelling evidence to support selective LN dissection strategies to preserve uiLNs.

Here, we unveiled a lactate-mediated mechanism driving vasculogenic mimicry (VM) and bevacizumab resistance through PKM2 lactylation. PKM2 lactylation at K206 by AARS1 promoted PKM2 nuclear translocation and interaction with FOSL1. PKM2 binding facilitated FOSL1-dependent super-enhancer formation and target gene transcription, which contributed to CRC cell VM. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PKM2 lactylation disrupted VM and synergized with bevacizumab in patient-derived pre-clinical models, significantly improving therapeutic efficacy. Together, this study reveals lactylation as a metabolic switch linking cancer glycolytic reprogramming to transcriptional rewiring and proposes targeting PKM2 lactylation to enhance the anti-tumor activity of bevacizumab in CRC.

**6.** **GSE304885 肠道浆细胞样树突状细胞优先产生干扰素λ [scRNA-seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：scRNA、regex:intestin(e|al)
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : David A Constant ; Timothy J NiceSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing ; OtherOrganism : Mus musculusThe healthy intestine mounts immune responses to microbiota to maintain homeostasis, which includes basal production of interferon cytokines. Previous work showed that Type III Interferon (IFN-λ) stimulates localized pockets of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the adult mouse intestinal epithelium at homeostasis that provide preemptive protection from viral pathogens. Here, we demonstrate that a major source of homeostatic IFN-λ production in the intestine is a population of epithelium-associated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). These pDC are recruited to the intestine by bacterial microbiota colonization, and pDC depletion or bone marrow reconstitution with IFN-λ-deficient pDC results in reduced homeostatic ISGs in the intestinal epithelium. Notably, intestinal pDC preferentially produce IFN-λ over Type I IFNs whereas splenic pDC produce more Type I IFNs. Comparison of splenic and intestinal pDC reveal tissue-specific changes in gene expression and genomic accessibility, including evidence of response to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) in the intestine. Isolated gut pDC produce more IFN-λ that splenic pDC upon stimulation, and pre-treatment of a human pDC cell line with TGF-β results in enhanced production of IFN-λ upon stimulation. This study implicates pDC as important sources of homeostatic IFN-λ in the intestine and defines the role of barrier cytokine TGF-β in regulating IFN types produced by pDC upon stimulation. Reprogramming of recruited pDC by tissue cytokines may have important implications for balancing effective antimicrobial responses with damaging inflammation at barrier tissues.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Xie Wei ; Verstraeten Bruno ; Vandenabeele PeterSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusAberrant intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) death is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), observed in patient samples and animal models of colitis. While multiple cell death pathways contribute to disease pathogenesis, the dominant modalities and their regulatory mechanisms in IBD remain poorly defined. In this study, we demonstrate that mice with intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of caspase-3 and -7 (Casp3/7 Tg) exhibit exacerbated colitis, increased mortality, and impaired epithelial regeneration, phenotypes not observed in other cell death-related knockout models. These findings highlight a previously unrecognized protective role of caspase-3/7 in controlling inflammation and tissue regeneration following intestinal injury. Mechanistically, caspase-3/7 deficiency negatively affects intestinal stem cell proliferation and promotes GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis, compromising barrier integrity and return to steady state conditions. Together, our results identify caspase-3/7 as key regulators of epithelial integrity and inflammation and suggest their modulation as a promising therapeutic strategy in IBD and colorectal cancer.

**9.** **GSE240483 NAD+ 控制心脏衰老过程中的昼夜节律**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：aging、cardiac
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Bryce J Carpenter ; Margaux Lecacheur ; Yannick N Mangold ; Kai Cui ; Stefan Günther ; Marit W Vermunt ; Pieterjan DierickxSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusDisruption of the circadian clock as well as reduced NAD+ levels are both hallmarks of aging. While circadian rhythms and NAD+ metabolism have been linked in heart disease, their relationship during cardiac aging is less clear. Here, we show that aging leads to disruption of diurnal gene expression in the heart. Long-term supplementation with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) boosts NAD+ levels, reprograms the diurnal transcriptome, and reverses naturally occurring cardiac enlargement in aged female mice. In addition, drastic reduction of NAD+ levels in CMs impairs PER2::luc oscillations, which is rescued by NR supplementation. Finally, we demonstrate that changes to the cardiac transcriptome due to NR treatment partially depend on the activity of SIRT1. These findings reveal an essential role for NAD+ in regulation of the cardiac circadian clock upon aging, which opens up new avenues to counteract age-related cardiac disorders.

**10.** **GSE309277 一种简单的液态3D细胞培养模型模拟了与肺转移相关的上皮乳腺癌细胞的氧化线粒体代谢**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、metabolism
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Balamurugan Kuppusamy ; Esta SterneckSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensThree-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems have emerged as powerful tools to model tumor biology ex vivo. However, the diverse array of 3D culture methods available presents challenges in selecting the most appropriate model for specific research questions. This study provides a comparative analysis of breast cancer cells (SUM149, IBC-3, MDA-MB-468) in the mammosphere culture (SphC) model or an “emboli” culture (EmC) model, which enrich for cancer stem cells and epithelial features, respectively. The EmC model, designed originally for inflammatory breast cancer, is characterized by media viscosity and mechanical rocking of the culture vessel. Notably, cells in EmC showed a distinct and durable reduction in cell proliferation while demonstrating increased capacity to establish experimental lung metastases. Quantitative analysis of electron microscopy images suggested that cells in EmC acquire nuclear and mitochondrial features that resemble those of tumor tissue. Proteomics, single-cell transcriptomics, and metabolic flux analyses showed that cells in EmC and SphC favor mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (OXPHOS) and glycolysis, respectively. EmC rendered cells hypersensitive to OXPHOS inhibition, yet more resistant to oxidative stress. Several genes associated with lung metastasis, including ID1, were specifically enriched in EmC. Given the increasingly recognized role of OXPHOS in cancer cell survival during dissemination and as established metastases, we propose that the EmC paradigm is a suitable ex vivo model to study signaling pathways relevant for tumor tissue and to assess drug sensitivities and resistance mechanisms of metastatic breast cancer cells ex vivo
