- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、regex:onco(logy|logist|gene|genic)、scRNA、KRAS
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Chantal Allgoewer ; Markus Breunig ; Alexander KlegerSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensBackground: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) are highly lethal and aggressive with oncogenic KRAS being the main oncogenic driver of the disease. PDACs have been extensively profiled at advanced stages, and in advanced disease the tumor microenvironment is a major determinant that critically shapes patient outcomes. Since the molecular events occurring prior to invasive growth remain poorly understood, we aimed to investigate changes in the precancerous epithelium and its surrounding niche.Methods: We acquired time-resolved, single-cell transcriptomic (scRNAseq), and accessible-chromatin data from human pluripotent stem cell-derived pancreatic duct-like organoids (PDLO) inducibly expressing KRASG12D and from various niche cells. Results: Analysis of the pure epithelium already revealed key signatures of matrix remodeling and inflammation-related signaling upon few days of KRASG12D expression. Machine learning captured KRASG12D-dependent transcriptomic classifiers with high prediction accuracy and niche preparatory relevance. Various co-culture approaches followed by scRNAseq and functional validation, including T-cell microfluidics, demonstrated that the KRASG12D-induced PDLO-secretome activates pancreatic stellate cells (PaSCs) and protects precancerous organoids from T cell infiltration. Additional, in silico approaches reconstructed a virtual pancreatic (pre)cancerous space to profile cell-cell interactions between PDLOs and niche cells. TNFα emerged as a top-ranked ligand and was functionally validated to mediate T-cell shielding and PaSC activation. Cyst fluid from 80 prospectively sampled Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMNs) –well-known cystic PDAC precursor lesions– showed a stepwise TNFα rise across LGD (low-grade), HGD (high-grade), and IC (invasive cancer).Conclusion: Our study reveals that oncogenic KRAS orchestrates niche-preparatory programs that precede PDAC formation and highlight a T cell exclusion program governed by epithelial-derived TNFα.

**4.** ⭐ **GSE304485：来自13种TCGA癌症类型和正常组织的批量RNA-Seq基因表达谱，用于肿瘤分类**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、cancer、TCGA、RNA-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributor : Sergii BabichevSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensThis dataset includes bulk RNA-Seq gene expression profiles of 6310 samples from 13 cancer types and normal tissues, obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and processed using a standardized pipeline. The raw count matrix, initially containing 60,660 genes, was filtered to retain only valid ENTREZ gene identifiers matched via the org.Hs.eg.db annotation package. Genes with zero variance across samples were removed. Normalization was performed by transforming expression values into log2 Counts Per Million (CPM) using the edgeR::cpm() function with log transformation. To ensure all values were positive and suitable for downstream modeling, a global shift was applied by adding the absolute minimum value. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed across all three categories (Biological Process, Molecular Function, Cellular Component) using the TopGO package. Significant genes were selected, followed by Benjamini–Hochberg p-value correction, and validated using both Fisher’s and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests. The resulting expression matrix consists of 18,564 functionally relevant genes across 6310 samples and forms the basis for clustering, classification, and metric evaluation within hybrid modeling frameworks for cancer diagnostics.

**5.** ⭐ **GSE319409 利用空间转录组学绘制创伤性脑损伤的继发反应图谱显示，急性 4-氨基吡啶治疗可减轻轴突和分子病理学**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：spatial、spatial transcriptomics、transcriptomics
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Genevieve M Sullivan ; Kryslaine L Radomski ; Shaoqiu He ; Matthew D Wilkerson ; Clifton L Dalgard ; Camille Alba ; Xiaomei Zi ; Martin L Doughty ; Regina C ArmstrongSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Mus musculusDamage to long myelinated axons of white matter tracts is a hallmark pathology resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) forces and secondary injury processes. 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) is an FDA-approved Kv1 potassium channel inhibitor designed to mitigate axon dysfunction. We examined repurposing 4-AP as an acute TBI treatment using clinically-oriented neuropathology of axon damage combined with unbiased genome-wide spatial transcriptomics for comprehensive analysis of secondary injury processes. Adult male and female mice received a non-penetrating impact TBI with 4-AP (i.p., b.i.d) on days 1-7 post-injury. Along corpus callosum (CC) axons, TBI disrupted node of Ranvier domains, exposing the putative 4-AP target of mislocalized Kv1 channels (p < 0.005). Clinically reasonable 4-AP dosing (0.5 mg/kg) reduced nodal Nav1.6 channel loss (p < 0.05) and Caspr heminode formation (p < 0.005) after injury. Quantification of β-amyloid precursor protein immunolabeling showed significantly reduced CC axon damage at 4-AP doses of 0.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg (each p < 0.005). 4-AP safety, based on potential seizure risk after TBI, was unaltered with vehicle or 0.5 mg/kg 4-AP, while the 5 mg/kg dose induced seizure behavior in sham and TBI groups (p < 0.0001). Spatial transcriptomics mapped molecular signatures to tissue pathology. TBI increased axonal injury response genes in the CC and in motor and somatosensory cortex sites of CC projection neurons. TBI induced disease-associated glial phenotypes that mapped predominantly within the CC. TBI increased pathway expression for immune and vascular functions, neuron and glial cell signaling, and cellular dyshomeostasis, while reducing expression in myelination-related pathways. Gene expression analysis of 4-AP treatment (0.5 mg/kg) indicated potassium channel target engagement and increased neuroaxonal activity, along with dampened secondary injury responses. Collectively, these findings reveal underlying molecular pathology of the secondary injury response and advance 4-AP translation to reduce axon damage and stimulate activity-dependent repair after acute TBI.

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：metabolism、RNA-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributor : Hye Kyung LeeSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusGrowth hormone (GH) signaling through STAT5B is a central regulator of hepatic metabolism, yet the functional consequences of disease-associated STAT5B variants remain poorly understood. Here, we generated mice carrying STAT5BY665F (gain-of-function) and STAT5BY665H (loss-of-function) alleles using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated base editing to dissect their impact on metabolic regulation. STAT5BY665F mutants developed hepatic lipid accumulation, hypercholesterolemia, and enhanced insulin sensitivity, whereas STAT5BY665H mice displayed reduced body weight and impaired insulin responsiveness. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that STAT5BY665F strongly activated lipid, cholesterol, and immune transcriptional programs, while STAT5BY665H failed to induce these pathways. ChIP-seq demonstrated extensive STAT5BY665F enhancer occupancy at metabolic and immune loci, contrasting with the minimal chromatin engagement of STAT5BY665H. Beyond the liver, STAT5BY665F broadly reprogrammed adipose tissue gene expression, activating lipid metabolism and immune regulatory networks, whereas STAT5BY665H exerted more restricted effects. Notably, transcriptional and chromatin remodeling by STAT5B variants displayed sex-dependent differences, with male livers showing more pronounced reprogramming than females. Together, these findings illustrate how alterations in STAT5B activity that alter enhancer activation led to altered metabolic function in liver and adipose tissue.
