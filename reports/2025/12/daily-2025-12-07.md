- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Alison Maclean ; Emily Johnson ; Corie Rushworth ; Christopher J Hill ; Eva Caamano-Gutierrez ; Dharani K HapangamaSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Homo sapiensAdenomyosis is a common gynaecological condition characterised by ectopic endometrial tissue within the myometrium, causing debilitating symptoms with limited treatment options. Despite its prevalence, the pathogenesis of adenomyosis remains poorly understood, hindering the development of targeted therapies for true disease modification rather than symptom management. The objective of this study was to elucidate the spatial transcriptomic profile of adenomyosis lesions with matched eutopic endometrial subregions, with a focus on specific cell types and tissue compartments. The study was designed to identify differentially expressed genes, functionally enriched pathways, and cell-cell communication networks within adenomyosis lesions compared to matched endometrial subregions, and to nominate potential drug targets for future therapeutic development. We show that adenomyosis lesions exhibit a distinct transcriptome intermediate between matched endometrium and myometrium, with enhanced epithelial ciliation and altered biological pathways. We reveal that lesion transcriptome is more like the endometrial basalis than the functionalis, displaying increased olfactory signalling, altered oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis, and an altered immune microenvironment suggestive of chronic inflammation. In silico drug screening identified potential compounds that can reverse the adenomyosis lesion transcriptome. These findings provide insights into the molecular landscape of adenomyosis lesions and pave the way for developing novel, lesion-specific treatments that could potentially spare the eutopic endometrium and offer alternatives to hysterectomy.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：immune、metabolic
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Milan R Savani ; Mohamad El Shami ; Bailey C Smith ; Samuel K McBrayerSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensBackground In vivo stable isotope tracing is useful for natively surveying glioma metabolism but can be difficult to implement. Stable isotope tracing is tractable using in vitro glioma models, but most models lack nutrient conditions and cell populations relevant to human gliomas. This limits our ability to study glioma metabolism in the presence of an intact tumor microenvironment (TME) and immune-metabolic crosstalk. Methods We optimized an in vitro stable isotope tracing approach for human glioma explants and glioma stem-like cell (GSC) lines that integrates human plasma-like medium (HPLM). We performed 15N2-glutamine tracing in GSC monocultures and human IDH-wildtype glioblastoma explants and developed an analytical framework to evaluate microenvironment-dependent metabolic features that distinguish them. We also conducted spatial transcriptomics to assess transcriptional correlates to metabolic activities. Results Human plasma-like medium culture preserved glioma explant viability and stemness while unmasking metabolic and immune programs suppressed by conventional culture conditions. Stable isotope tracing in HPLM revealed TME-dependent and TME-independent features of tumor metabolism. Tissue explants recapitulated tumor cell-intrinsic metabolic activities, such as synthesis of immunomodulatory purines. Unlike GSC monocultures, tissue explants captured tumor cell-extrinsic activities associated with stromal cell metabolism, as exemplified by astrocytic guanosine diphosphate mannose production in heterocellular explants. Finally, glioma explants displayed tumor subtype-specific metabolic reprogramming, including robust pyrimidine degradation in mesenchymal cells. Conclusions We present a tractable approach to assess glioma metabolism in vitro under physiologic nutrient levels and in the presence of an intact TME. This platform opens new avenues to interrogate glioma metabolism and its interplay with the immune microenvironment.

**5.** **GSE292908 抗CSF-1R疗法联合免疫化疗协调适应性免疫反应以消除富含巨噬细胞的三阴性乳腺癌**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：immune、macrophage
- 📝 **描述**：Series Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusPatients diagnosed with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC) have limited treatment options, are more prone to develop resistance and are associated with high mortality. A cold tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) characterized by low T cells and high tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in mTNBC is associated with the failure of standard-of-care chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment. We demonstrate that the combination of immunostimulatory metronomic Cytoxan (CTX) coupled with anti-CSF-1R antibody targeted therapy (SNDX-ms6352) and anti-PD-1 (ICB), was highly effective against aggressive metastatic syngeneic Trp53 null TNBC genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) that present with high macrophage infiltration. Mechanistically, CSF-1R inhibition along with CTX disrupted the M-CSF/CSF-1R axis which upregulated IL-17, IL-15 and type II interferon and elevated B- and T cells. Addition of an anti-PD-1 maintenance dose was necessary to overcome de novo PD-L1 intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) associated recurrence in lung and liver mTNBC.

**6.** **GSE303831 oHSV介导的JAG1阻断诱导胶质瘤衰老相关分泌表型，从而增强巨噬细胞活化并提高对西妥昔单抗介导的衰老细胞清除的敏感性 II**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：macrophage、glioma
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Kimberly A Rivera-Caraballo ; Tae Jin Lee ; Arnoneel Sinha ; Marco Orecchioni ; Karina Vazquez-Arreguin ; Shilpa Sharma ; Kimya Jones ; Upasana Sahu ; Sara A Murphy ; Bangxing Hong ; Ravindra Kolhe ; Ashok Sharma ; Balveen KaurSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensOncolytic HSV-1 (oHSV) treatment induces Notch signaling and myelosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of preclinical models. In the clinic, upregulation of JAG1 gene expression was observed in recurrent high-grade glioma patients treated with CAN-3110. Since JAG1 is expressed on both glioma cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and its expression correlated with a worse prognosis, we engineered a JAG1-antagonizing oHSV (OncoD-0J1) and interrogated its impact on the tumor and myeloid TME. OncoD-0J1 antagonized JAG1-mediated Notch signaling and had a significant therapeutic advantage in vivo, which relied on Notch signature in tumor cells. Kinome profiling revealed that OncoD-0J1 treatment suppressed CDK1, resulting in a G2/M cell cycle checkpoint as seen by cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle arrest led to senescence and correlated with increased reactive oxygen species, p62 accumulation, autophagosome accumulation, and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. This resulted in increased production of inflammatory chemokines and DAMPs such as IL-1β and extracellular ATP. RNA sequencing of murine macrophages co-cultured with infected human tumor cells showed enrichment of chemotactic and pro-inflammatory pathways as well as increased Fc receptor activation following OncoD-0J1 infection. Single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometric analysis of F4/80+ cells isolated from infected tumors showed a shift from tumor-supporting TAMs to inflammatory macrophages upon OncoD-0J1 treatment. Senescent cells showed heightened EGFR activation as a mechanism to escape death, which created a unique vulnerability for cetuximab as a senolytic agent. Combination therapy reduced EGFR signaling and induced macrophage-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, thereby increasing the anti-tumor therapeutic response of OncoD-0J1 as a monotherapy.

**7.** **GSE312113 急性去神经支配的肌肉细胞外囊泡通过逆行信号传导重塑神经元线粒体代谢，从而挽救周围神经损伤**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：metabolism、Neuronal
- 📝 **描述**：Series Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Rattus norvegicusPeripheral nerve injury causes muscle atrophy due to slow axonal regeneration, highlighting an unmet therapeutic need. Although neuromuscular interactions are classically viewed as unidirectionally nerve-dominated, we show that acutely denervated muscle (adMu) regulates nerve regeneration via a retrograde signaling pathway. adMu initiates a trans-tissue regulatory mechanism through extracellular vesicles (EVsadMu) that orchestrate neural energy homeostasis to accelerate regeneration. Functional profiling identifies IDH2 and CS as key metabolic enzymes within EVsadMu. Neurons treated with EVsadMu exhibit a 1.39-fold increase in NADPH/NADP+ ratio via IDH2, along with a 1.18- and 1.27-fold increase in NADH/NAD+ and FADH2/FAD ratios via CS, fueling the TCA cycle to enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics. This restores redox balance and energy supply, driving axonal regeneration. In sciatic nerve injury models, EVadMu-microneedle conduits significantly promote energy metabolism and functional recovery. Together, our findings position adMu as a metabolic signaling center enabling retrograde regulation for nerve regeneration, offering potential for clinical translation.

**8.** **GSE311272 SAFB1/SAFB2 敲除或 ERH 敲除对小鼠 Baf3 细胞 miRNA 转录组的影响**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：transcriptome
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Sebastian Herzog ; Aschenwald SimonSeries Type : Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusMicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional silencing of most mammalian genes. They are generated in a multi-step process initiated by the Microprocessor, a protein complex composed of DROSHA and DGCR8. Recent studies have described the phenomenon of “cluster assistance”, in which a prototypic primary miRNA hairpin can license the Microprocessor-mediated processing of a clustered suboptimal hairpin in cis. Mechanistic analyses led to the identification of two critical factors for this process, SAFB2 (scaffold attachment factor B2) and ERH (enhancer of rudimentary homolog), but it remains unclear to which extent these factors contribute to and are required for cluster assistance. Here, we have used a previously established dual fluorescence reporter system (doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2020.05.011) to generate loss-of-function clones for SAFB2 and its closely related family member SAFB1 as well as for ERH.Our data indicate that loss of SAFB1/2 and of ERH results in overlapping, but not identical defects in primary miRNA biogenesis.

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：RNA-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Xuan Xie ; Asya Khleborodova ; Tovah E Markowitz ; Ethan M ShevachSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusEos, a member of the Ikaros family of transcription factors, is expressed by T regulatory cells (Tregs) and has been postulated to play a role in Treg suppression and maintenance of Treg stability. We demonstrate that expression of Eos was limited to a subpopulation of thymus-derived, activated Tregs and is undetectable in resting or activated T conventional cells (Tconvs). Eos associates with Helios, Foxp3 and Hdac1 and binds directly to the CD25 locus at a site identical to the Foxp3 binding site resulting in enhancement of CD25 expression. Studies in heterozygous female mice demonstrate that Eos is critical for Treg survival and activation. Eos+ Tregs also represent the major population of recirculating thymic Tregs, in which Eos plays a critical role in regulating their migration and suppression of Treg precursors in the thymus by competing for IL-2 and depleting MHC II from thymic dendritic cells (DCs).

- 🏷️ **关键词**：肿瘤
- 📝 **描述**：Secret hovertext: 肿瘤相关中性粒细胞（TAN）的异质性已被认识，但 TAN 的不同细胞状态如何出现、演化、分布并影响癌症免疫治疗疗效仍难以理解。通过单细胞 RNA 测序、空间转录组学和遗传作，我们表明抗 PDL1 + CD40 激动剂免疫疗法能够诱导 TANs 中的干扰素反应，使其在鳞状细胞癌（SCCs）中恢复抗肿瘤活性。相比之下，位于肿瘤-基质界面的 TAN 可以保持其免疫抑制状态。重要的是，我们在肿瘤-间质界面识别出一组 SOX2 高肿瘤起始干细胞（tSCs），它们上调脂肪酸去饱和酶 1（Fads1）生成花生四烯酸（AA）。该 tSC 特异性通路增强 TAN 中的前列腺素 E2（PGE2）信号，从而破坏干扰素反应，阻止 TANs 中干扰素诱导的抗肿瘤功能。通过微调中性粒细胞的可塑性，tSCs 塑造了中性粒细胞的异质性，塑造了一个保护性的微生态位，以在免疫治疗中存活并推动癌症复发。
