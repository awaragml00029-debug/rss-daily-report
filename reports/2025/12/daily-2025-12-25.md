- 🏷️ **关键词**：monocyte、inflammation、regex:immuno(logy|therapy|suppression)、scRNA
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Zining Wang ; Jiaming Hu ; Yiyu Guo ; Xinrui Zhang ; Yu Gao ; Nan Song ; Rong FuSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensAplastic anemia (AA) is a bone marrow failure disorder caused by diverse etiologies. AA pathogenesis involves aberrant immune activation and an imbalanced inflammatory bone marrow microenvironment. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling in patients with AA can improve multilineage hematopoietic recovery and immune balance. This study is the first to demonstrate the synergistic mechanisms of TGF-β inhibitor luspatercept in combination with Cyclosporine and Eltrombopag for the treatment of severe aplastic anemia (SAA) by acting on monocytes. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed increased inflammatory cytokine levels and elevated expression of pyroptosis-related genes in monocytes after luspatercept withdrawal. Mechanistic investigations further showed luspatercept suppressed pyroptosis in monocytes, reshaping the immune microenvironment, and attenuating pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and cytotoxic molecule expression in CD8+T cells. This groundbreaking study uncovers that Luspatercept can reduce inflammation and pyroptosis through multi-target immune modulation, which provides a novel therapeutic strategy for AA.

**6.** **GSE307919 芳香族微生物代谢产物马尿酸通过 TLR-MyD88 信号通路和脂质重塑增强巨噬细胞的促炎反应**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：TLR、regex:micro(b|be|bial|organism)
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Gauri Mirji ; Rahul S ShindeSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusThe gut microbiome generates a diverse array of metabolites that actively shape host immunity, yet the pro-inflammatory potential of microbial metabolites remains incompletely understood. Using a non-targeted, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics, we identified hippuric acid, an aromatic gut microbe-derived metabolite, as a potent enhancer of pro-inflammatory responses in Escherichia coli infection model. Intraperitoneal administration of hippuric acid significantly heightened pro-inflammatory responses, promoted innate immune cell activation, and reduced survival in infected mice. Similar pro-inflammatory effects were observed in an LPS-induced inflammation model. In vitro, hippuric acid selectively potentiated M1-like macrophage polarization (LPS + IFNγ) but had no effect on M2-like polarization (IL-4). Hippuric acid further augmented responses to multiple myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, but not to TRIF-dependent TLR3, or to cytosolic innate immune stimuli such as STING and NOD2 agonists, implicating TLR-MyD88 signaling as a likely mechanism of action. Genetic deletion of MyD88 abrogated the pro-inflammatory effects of hippuric acid both in vitro and in vivo, confirming its dependence on the MyD88 pathway. Transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses revealed that hippuric acid upregulated cholesterol biosynthesis and induced lipid accumulation. Pharmacological reduction of cellular cholesterol using fluvastatin or 25-hydroxycholesterol attenuated its pro-inflammatory effects. Notably, hippuric acid also enhanced pro-inflammatory responses in human macrophages, and its elevated levels correlated with increased sepsis mortality, underscoring its clinical relevance. Together, these findings identify hippuric acid as a previously unrecognized microbial-derived pro-inflammatory modulator that links gut microbial metabolism, lipid remodeling, and innate immune signaling, and offer new insights into its role in infection and inflammation.

**7.** **GSE305139 唐氏综合征人类皮层发育的单细胞多组学图谱 - 胎儿皮层批量 RNA 测序数据集**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：RNA-seq、single-cell
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Michael Lattke ; Vincenzo De PaolaSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensDown syndrome, caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21, is the most common genetic form of intellectual disability, which affects up to 1 in 700 live births. Yet, how increased dosage of the ~200 protein-coding genes on human chromosome 21 affects cortical development and function remains unclear. Here we generated a single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility atlas of the human foetal cortex at mid gestation (11-20 weeks after conception), a critical period of cortical development. We uncovered an early global transcriptional network disruption, subtly altering ~1000 genes involved in neural development and function primarily in excitatory neurons. These changes reflected clinical phenotypes like intellectual disability and epilepsy, were accompanied by a significant reduction in layer 4 neurons, and were driven by a network of transcription factors including chromosome 21 genes BACH1, PKNOX1, and GABPA. Finally, a xenograft model replicates key molecular features, offering an experimental platform for validating new therapeutic targets. This resource defines the gene-regulatory landscape of the developing human cortex in Down syndrome, revealing the earliest known molecular and cellular signatures of its neurological manifestations and novel candidate targets for therapeutic interventions.

**10.** **GSE304589 揭示巨噬细胞 IFNγ 信号传导中非传统的 JAK1/2-STAT3 分支 [ChIP-Seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：macrophage、ChIP-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Mees Botman ; Josje Huisman ; Marten A HoeksemaSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusInterferon-γ (IFNγ) is a key cytokine in immune activation and anti-viral responses that classically signals via JAK1/2-mediated STAT1 homodimers to drive macrophage activation. Here, we identify a non-canonical signaling component in which IFNγ also activates STAT3. Our results show that IFNγ activates STAT3 rapidly and directly through JAK1 and JAK2. We provide the first evidence that STAT3 can form heterodimers with STAT1 in this context and demonstrate that STAT3 is co-recruited to a subset of IFNγ-induced, STAT1-bound regulatory elements. While IFNγ directly activates STAT3, our results reveal that its contribution to gene regulation is limited, indicating that STAT1 easily substitutes the STAT1–STAT3 heterodimer for STAT1 homodimers when STAT3 is absent. These findings uncover STAT3 as a new unconventional player in macrophage IFNγ signaling, underscoring the complex and context-dependent nature of cytokine signaling networks.

**1.** ⭐ **你室友的基因可能正在影响你的肠道菌群。**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：bacteria、regex:bacter(ia|ial|ium)、gut、regex:gut(-?microbiome)?
- 📝 **描述**：Scientists studying thousands of rats discovered that gut bacteria are shaped by both personal genetics and the genetics of social partners. Some genes promote certain microbes that can spread between individuals living together. When researchers accounted for this social sharing, genetic influence on the microbiome turned out to be much stronger than previously thought. The study suggests genes can affect others indirectly, without DNA ever being exchanged.

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer
- 📝 **描述**：Scientists at MIT and Stanford have unveiled a promising new way to help the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. Their strategy targets a hidden “off switch” that tumors use to stay invisible to immune defenses—special sugar molecules on the cancer cell surface that suppress immune activity. Early tests show it can supercharge immune responses and outperform current antibody therapies.

**5.** **这些纳米颗粒能杀死癌细胞，同时不伤及健康细胞。**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer
- 📝 **描述**：Researchers have created tiny metal-based particles that push cancer cells over the edge while leaving healthy cells mostly unharmed. The particles work by increasing internal stress in cancer cells until they trigger their own shutdown process. In lab tests, they killed cancer cells far more effectively than healthy ones. The technology is still early-stage, but it opens the door to more precise and gentler cancer treatments.
