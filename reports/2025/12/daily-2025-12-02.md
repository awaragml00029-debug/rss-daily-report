- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Grace Tan ; Natalia Savelyeva ; Chuan Wang ; Martina Meschis ; Christian OttensmeierSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusImmunotherapy has demonstrated durable responses in a subset of patients with head and neck cancer, offering potential survival benefits to those with poor prognoses and resistance to first-line treatments. Despite this, only a modest 15-20% are shown to respond. Cancer vaccines have recently demonstrated efficacy in some solid tumours including melanoma, as well as immune-cold pancreatic and liver cancer, inducing a cytotoxic T cell response and eradicating cancer cells. Our previous research identified cancer testis antigens MAGED4B and FJX1 as highly immunogenic and overexpressed in the majority of HPV-independent head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HPVnegHNSCC) patients. In this study, we developed a novel DNA vaccine utilising the non-plasmid doggyboneTM (dbDNATM) platform to deliver these antigens for targeting head and neck cancer. A series of doggyboneTM vaccine prototypes targeting MAGED4B and FJX1 were generated both to optimise the backbone and to present antigens in an immunogenic form. Vaccine immunogenicity and cytotoxicity were accessed using interferon-gamma. Enzyme-Linked Immunospot (ELISpot) assay. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated in the MOC-2 oral cancer model through tumour monitoring, assessing the infiltration of CD4+, CD8+ and regulatory T cells by immunohistochemistry as well as RNAseq analysis. The optimised dual antigen dbDNA DNA vaccine significantly reduced tumour size. Furthermore, combining the vaccine with anti-PD1 therapy significantly delayed tumour growth and metastasis, thereby enhancing survival in tumour-bearing mice. Vaccination resulted in significant recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but not regulatory T cells. IHC analysis also confirmed the ability of dbDNA™ vaccine TGL-100 OPT in shifting M2 to M1 polarisation, highlighting their therapeutic promise. Transcriptomic analysis of immune cells in the tumour indicates that vaccination promotes long term anti-tumour responses by upregulating memory T cell genes T cell factor-7 (Tcf7) and lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (Lef1) while suppressing PDL-1 and inhibiting anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-27. These findings suggest that our cancer vaccine effectively recruits cytotoxic T cells to immune cold tumours, minimising the host’s immune inhibitory mechanisms within...

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Yunching Chen ; Hsin-Mei LeeSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by an immunosuppressive stroma rich in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that limit the therapeutic efficacy. We introduce a TAM-targeted nanotherapy platform that selectively delivers either a CSF1R inhibitor or the STING agonist cGAMP to immunosuppressive TAMs. While CSF1R inhibitor–loaded nanoparticles efficiently depleted TAMs and produced moderate antitumor effects, TAM-targeted cGAMP nanoparticles reprogrammed TAMs into immune-stimulating effectors. This reprogramming normalized aberrant vasculature, alleviated desmoplasia, and enhanced infiltration and activation of cytotoxic immune cells. In combination with gemcitabine, PD-1 checkpoint blockade, or CAR-NK cell therapy, TAM-targeted STING activation provided an in situ immunostimulatory signal that markedly improved antitumor efficacy in preclinical PDAC models. Ex vivo efficacy in human PDAC tissues and a favorable safety profile show the translational potential of this TAM-targeted nanotherapy to overcome the immune desert of PDAC.

Dermal white adipose tissue transitioned from metabolic homeostasis to immune activation and inflammatory remodeling, accompanied by sustained lipolysis. Concurrently, CD45⁺ immune cells accumulated in the lower dermis and dWAT. These findings identify dWAT as an immune-metabolic hub orchestrating inflammatory progression and highlight spatial transcriptomics as a powerful tool for dissecting skin niche regulation.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、immune、methylation
- 📝 **描述**：Series Type : Methylation profiling by high throughput sequencing ; Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensColorectal cancer (CRC) progression and recurrence persist as major clinical challenges despite standard therapies. Emerging evidence underscores that tumor relapse arises from crosstalk between malignant cells and the immunosuppressive microenvironment, yet the role of non-histone lysine methylation in this interplay remains unclear. Here, we identify di-methylation of lysine 513 (K513) on methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) as a key epigenetic modification associated with CRC progression and recurrence. Mechanistically, we reveal that SETD1A catalyzes METTL3 K513 methylation, enhancing its binding affinity to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and augmenting RNA m⁶A deposition. Strikingly, METTL3 methylation suppresses endogenous retroelements expression, leading to impaired type I interferon responses and tumor immune evasion. We further uncover a fluorouracil-induced E2F4/SETD1A/METTL3 regulatory axis, wherein E2F4 self-regulation activates SETD1A to drive METTL3 methylation. Targeting this axis through pharmacological inhibition of E2F4 or genetic disruption of METTL3 methylation synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), significantly suppressing tumor growth. Our findings unveil a methylation-dependent regulatory mechanism that reshapes the tumor immune microenvironment, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for CRC.

**10.** ⭐ **GSE276263 Epigenetic insights into fertility: involvement of immune cell methylation in dairy cows reproduction**

- 🏷️ **关键词**：immune、epigenetic、methylation
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Lotfi Bouzeraa ; Helene Martin ; Clement Plessis ; Pascal Dufour ; Jessica C Marques ; Sydney Moore ; Ronaldo Cerri ; Marc-Andre SirardSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Bos taurusInfertility and post-partum reproductive diseases present significant clinical and economic challenges, particularly in cattle farming. Successful gestation is largely contingent upon the ability of the maternal immune system to recognize and tolerate the embryo. The role of immune cells in promoting fetal-maternal immune tolerance is critical, underlining their importance in post-partum fertility. In this context, DNA methylation in hematopoietic cells may play a pivotal role in determining the susceptibility of the animal to post-partum fertility problems. Identifying epigenetic changes linked to infertility is therefore crucial for advancing sustainable animal production. Characterizing the methylome of immune cells in relation to fertility will enable early phenotyping, setting the stage for innovative methods to detect potential subfertility in animals. In our study, whole epigenome sequencing and enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq) were employed to analyze the DNA methylation patterns in total blood collected from twelve Holstein cows raised on the same farm before any disease appeared. This approach helped to map the epigenetic modification profiles of genes associated with the varying fertility phenotypes observed the following year, revealing significant differences between fertile and subfertile cows. We identified 216,990 differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs), with three genes, Interferon tau-3 (IFNT3), KIAA0825, and RAS-Related Protein 2A (RAP2A), showing high significance. Additionally, 23 key genes affected by DMCs across five regions (transcription start sites-TSS shores, introns, exons, distal intergenic areas, and downstream of genes) were identified. Notably, Interferon tau-3 emerged as especially crucial due to its role in early embryonic development and the establishment of gestation in cattle, with seven DMCs in its TSS shores in subfertile cows. Similarly, the KLRA1 gene (Ly49), analogous to KIRs in humans and primarily expressed on Natural Killer (NK) cells, was highlighted for its potential impact on fertility. Past research underscored that a balance between activating and inhibiting KIR receptors is essential for embryo implantation and proper placental development. Moreover, interleukin genes, such as IL-6, IL15, IL22, IL-36G, which are vital f...

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer
- 📝 **描述**：Scientists have uncovered how too much sunlight can flip a hidden switch inside skin cells that makes inflammation spiral out of control and increases the risk of cancer. Their research reveals that UV radiation breaks down a protective protein called YTHDF2, which normally prevents a small RNA signal from activating an immune sensor linked to dangerous inflammation. Once that protection is lost, a surprising chain reaction unfolds inside the cell, turning ordinary sun damage into a potential cancer trigger.
