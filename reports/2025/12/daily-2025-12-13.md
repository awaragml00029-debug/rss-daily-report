**1.** ⭐ **GSE307931 循环转录组分析检测基因特征、免疫细胞活化和丰度，以预测膀胱癌免疫治疗反应**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、immune、regex:immuno(logy|therapy|suppression)、transcriptome
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Sandy Chevrier ; Corentin Richard ; Romain BoidotSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensBackground. Immune Checkpoint Blockers (ICB) have revolutionized oncology by achieving durable tumor responses in advanced cancers. Nevertheless, currently approved biomarkers (PD-L1, MSI, TMB) have suboptimal positive and negative predictive values for tumor response and survival. Patients and Methods. We aimed to assess the value of RNA sequencing from circulating blood, a new type of liquid biopsy, to predict responses to ICB. We performed total paired-end RNA sequencing at 20 million reads and analyzed differential gene expression, signaling pathway activation, and immune cell abundances according to cancer outcomes. The analysis was conducted on baseline frozen whole blood samples from 164 patients prospectively enrolled in the IOPREDI study. Results. We found that some immune-related genes and signaling pathways were highly expressed in patients who achieved a durable clinical benefit. Furthermore, analyses of both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) confirmed significantly higher expression levels of immune-related signaling pathways in long-term survivors. Gene expression signatures capable of classifying patients based on clinical response or PFS were also identified. Interestingly, deconvolution analysis revealed a significant higher abundance of resting NK cells in patients with prolonged PFS or OS, in contrast to other cytotoxic cell types. Finally, high expression of the CST7 gene and increased abundance of naïve B lymphocytes were associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Conclusion. Total RNA sequencing from whole blood provides high-quality data to predict clinical response, survival, and occurrence of irAEs. The use of this liquid biopsy prior to immune checkpoint blockage could improve treatment efficacy and irAEs management.

**2.** **GSE313350 天冬酰胺合成酶和G蛋白偶联雌激素受体是KRAS突变型结直肠癌中营养供应的关键反应因子**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、KRAS
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Lingeng Lu ; Caroline Johnson ; Sajid KhanSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensSurvival differences exist in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients by sex and disease stage. However, the potential molecular mechanism(s) are not well understood. Here we show that asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1) are critical sensors of nutrient depletion and linked to poorer outcomes for females with CRC. In a 3D spheroid model of isogenic SW48 KRAS wild-type (WT) and G12A mutant (MT) cells grown under a restricted nutrient supply, we found that glutamine depletion inhibited cell growth in both cell types, whereas ASNS and GPER1 expression were upregulated in KRAS MT versus WT. Estradiol decreased growth in KRAS WT but had no effect on MT cells. In a clinical colon cancer cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas, both high GPER1 and ASNS expression were associated with poorer overall survival for females only in advanced stage tumors. These results suggest KRAS MT cells have mechanisms in place that respond to decreased nutrient supply, typically observed in advanced tumors, by increasing the expression of ASNS and GPER1 to drive cell growth. Furthermore, KRAS MT cells are resistant to the protective effects of estradiol under nutrient deplete conditions. The findings indicate that GPER1 and ASNS expression in the link of nutrient supply and KRAS mutations shed additional light on the mechanisms behind sex differences in metabolism and growth in CRC and have clinical implications in the precision management of KRAS MT CRC.

**3.** **GSE311963 CD38 赋予局部抗原特异性 Foxp3+ Treg 细胞应激耐受性，从而实现对中枢神经系统炎症的区室化控制**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：antigen、inflammation
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Andreas Muschaweckh ; Hsin-Hsiang Chen ; Rupert Öllinger ; Christopher Sie ; Thomas KornSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusFoxp3-expressing regulatory T (Treg) cells protect from systemic autoimmunity. However, little is known about the significance of Treg cells in inflammation-experienced tissues. Using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we show that Treg cells accumulate and persist in the central nervous system (CNS) until long after the resolution of the bulk of the inflammatory infiltrate. CNS-specific local depletion of post-inflammatory Treg cells, but not systemic depletion of Treg cells, immediately rekindles autoimmune inflammatory flares in the CNS by residual local effector T cells. Expression of the NAD-consuming ecto-enzyme CD38 is crucial for the functional adaptation of post-inflammatory CNS Treg cells to a stressful microenvironment, in which access to IL-2 is limited. CD38 counteracts ADP-ribosylation of the IL-2R and, thus, maintains its high sensitivity to IL-2. Their fully functional high-affinity IL-2 receptor prevents the loss of tissue-resident antigen-specific Treg cells. These "stress-tolerant" CNS Treg cells impede the collapse of immune homeostasis in the CNS once acute inflammation is controlled.

**4.** **GSE311075 TRMT112 在三阴性乳腺癌中驱动肿瘤生长和转移促进程序**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、cancer
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Dongquan Chen ; Lalita Samant ; Rajeev Samant ; Amr ElhamamsySeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensRibosomal RNA Modifying Proteins (RRMPs) are integral to ribosome biogenesis, executing post-transcriptional modifications that influence translation fidelity and efficiency. Dysregulation of RRMPs has been increasingly implicated in cancer progression, yet their collective role across malignancies remains largely unexplored. Here, we performed a multi-omics analysis of 22 RRMPs across diverse cancer types using The Cancer Genome Atlas, the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium, and additional high-throughput datasets. Our analysis revealed widespread genomic alterations and transcriptional dysregulation of RRMPs across malignancies, with distinct expression patterns in breast cancer subtypes. Notably, Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) exhibited the highest RRMPs enrichment, which correlated with increased genomic instability including elevated tumor mutational burden and aneuploidy scores, and poor survival outcomes. Among the RRMPs, tRNA methyltransferase activator subunit 11-2 (TRMT112) emerged as a key regulator of tumor progression. Functional assays demonstrated that TRMT112 knockdown in TNBC cells significantly reduced proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastatic potential, whereas its overexpression enhanced these tumorigenic properties. Polysome profiling and RNA sequencing of actively translated transcripts revealed that TRMT112 reprograms the translational landscape by promoting pro-metastatic and stromal remodeling pathways while suppressing immune-related processes. In vivo studies using an orthotopic breast cancer model further confirmed that TRMT112 depletion impairs tumor growth and reduces metastatic burden. Collectively, our findings establish RRMPs as critical modulators of cancer progression and identify TRMT112 as a key driver of aggressive phenotypes in TNBC. The dysregulation of TRMT112 across breast cancer subtypes highlights its potential as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target. These insights provide a mechanistic foundation for future interventions aimed at targeting TRMT112-driven translational programs in aggressive breast cancer.

**5.** **GSE304030 oHSV介导的JAG1阻断诱导胶质瘤衰老相关分泌表型，从而增强巨噬细胞活化并提高其对西妥昔单抗介导的衰老细胞清除的敏感性**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：macrophage、glioma
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Kimberly A Rivera-Caraballo ; Tae Jin Lee ; Arnoneel Sinha ; Marco Orecchioni ; Karina Vazquez-Arreguin ; Shilpa Sharma ; Kimya Jones ; Upasana Sahu ; Sara A Murphy ; Bangxing Hong ; Ravindra Kolhe ; Ashok Sharma ; Balveen KaurSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiens ; Mus musculusOncolytic HSV-1 (oHSV) treatment induces Notch signaling and myelosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of preclinical models. In the clinic, upregulation of JAG1 gene expression was observed in recurrent high-grade glioma patients treated with CAN-3110. Since JAG1 is expressed on both glioma cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and its expression correlated with a worse prognosis, we engineered a JAG1-antagonizing oHSV (OncoD-0J1) and interrogated its impact on the tumor and myeloid TME. OncoD-0J1 antagonized JAG1-mediated Notch signaling and had a significant therapeutic advantage in vivo, which relied on Notch signature in tumor cells. Kinome profiling revealed that OncoD-0J1 treatment suppressed CDK1, resulting in a G2/M cell cycle checkpoint as seen by cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle arrest led to senescence and correlated with increased reactive oxygen species, p62 accumulation, autophagosome accumulation, and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. This resulted in increased production of inflammatory chemokines and DAMPs such as IL-1β and extracellular ATP. RNA sequencing of murine macrophages co-cultured with infected human tumor cells showed enrichment of chemotactic and pro-inflammatory pathways as well as increased Fc receptor activation following OncoD-0J1 infection. Single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometric analysis of F4/80+ cells isolated from infected tumors showed a shift from tumor-supporting TAMs to inflammatory macrophages upon OncoD-0J1 treatment. Senescent cells showed heightened EGFR activation as a mechanism to escape death, which created a unique vulnerability for cetuximab as a senolytic agent. Combination therapy reduced EGFR signaling and induced macrophage-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, thereby increasing the anti-tumor therapeutic response of OncoD-0J1 as a monotherapy.
