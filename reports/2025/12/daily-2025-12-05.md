We performed spatial transcriptomics analysis of pre- and posttreatment tumor samples from the same patients to explore the underlying mechanisms of such early resistance. The proportion and activation of fibroblasts increased in association with the development of early resistance, whereas a distinct tumor cell cluster showed activation of tumor necrosis factor–α signaling via the NF-B pathway even before treatment. Also in the early resistance sample, specific tumor cell clusters interacted with immune and stromal cells. Immature tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) were enriched in the early resistance sample, whereas mature TLSs were observed in the long-term response sample. These findings implicate tumor heterogeneity and an inflammatory tumor microenvironment in early EGFR-TKI resistance, providing insight into potential therapeutic strategies to improve treatment outcomes.

We overcame these challenges by applying spatial omics approaches – providing necessary resolution and context – to primary untreated PDAC tumors from 39 patients capturing 340K low-bulk and 530K single-cell spatial transcriptomes. We observe a spectrum of classical-to-basal tumor subtypes present within all patients. We identify a distinct population of proliferative tumor cells enriched for the DNA synthesis-condensation-mitosis transcriptional network suggesting this subset disproportionately contribute to tumor growth. Furthermore, we characterize the microenvironment surrounding each tumor subtype and observe that basal identity is contextually defined by collagen, hypoxic adaptation and fibroblast neighbors expressing activated stroma and interferon stimulated gene therapy resistance signatures. Lastly, leveraging orthogonal patient, cell and mouse data, we determine which aspects of PDAC biology are recapitulated in bulk datasets and reductionist models.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Markus Schober ; Iman Osman ; Robert Stagnitta ; Pietro Berico ; Eva HernandoSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Homo sapiensUltraviolet (UV)-induced DNA mutations produce genetic drivers of cutaneous melanoma initiation and numerous neoantigens that can trigger anti-tumor immune responses in the host. Consequently, melanoma cells must rapidly evolve to evade immune detection by simultaneously modulating cell-autonomous epigenetic mechanisms and tumor-microenvironment interactions. Angiogenesis has been implicated in this process; although an increase of vasculature facilitates the immune response in normal tissue, solid tumors manage to somehow enhance blood flow while preventing immune cell infiltration. By comparing the expression of transcription factors (TFs) across early-stage melanoma, naevi, and other cancer types, we found the homeodomain-containing TF HOXD13 drives a melanoblast-like developmental program, which is upregulated in melanoma and strongly correlated with angiogenesis and immune cell exclusion. Using transcriptomics, 3D chromatin profiling, and in vivo models, we demonstrate that HOXD13 upregulation promotes tumor growth in vivo by concomitantly enhancing angiogenesis and suppressing T-cell infiltration. HOXD13 orchestrates 3D chromatin contacts between distal enhancers and promoters, simultaneously activating VEGFA, SEMA3A, and CD73. VEGFA and SEMA3A remodel the tumor vasculature and CD73 elevates extracellular levels of adenosine, a vasodilator and immune suppressor that binds adenosine receptors (AdR) on endothelial and T cells. In line with these findings, HOXD13-induced growth advantage in vivo was significantly reversed by the concomitant administration of VEGFR and AdR inhibitors. By revealing a dual pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive HOXD13-CD73/VEGF gene regulatory axis, we identify a subset of patients who might benefit from combinations of AdR and VEGFR inhibitors which are currently being tested in clinical trials.

However, the development of resistance remains a major clinical challenge, with various resistance mechanisms having been identified. Emerging evidence suggests that the tumor microenvironment (TME) may contribute to this resistance. In this study, we analyzed the TME of pre-treatment tumor samples from EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients using the Visium HD spatial transcriptomics platform to explore its potential role in the development of resistance.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Joseph S Durgin ; Sunny Y WongSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Homo sapiensAcne vulgaris is a common skin condition involving complex interactions among lipid-secreting sebaceous glands, keratinocytes, immune cells, and microbiota. While retinoids are effective for treating acne, disease pathogenesis remains poorly understood. In particular, it remains unclear how different subtypes of acne, including inflammatory (pustular) and non-inflammatory (comedonal) lesions, vary in gene expression, signaling, and sebaceous gland involvement. Here, we performed spatial transcriptomics on healthy, non-lesional, comedonal, and pustular acne skin using a custom panel targeting sebaceous differentiation, lipid metabolism, and retinoid signaling pathways. We also designed a specialized segmentation pipeline to improve transcript assignment in the spatially complex sebaceous gland. Our analyses identified a PPARG+ transitional basal cell state in sebocytes and revealed that comedonal skin upregulates sebogenesis genes, whereas pustular skin downregulates sebogenesis. Both lesion types exhibit increased AP-1 transcription factors and elevated FABP5, a chaperone that blunts retinoic acid receptor signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that an AP-1 inhibitor, T-5224, strongly downregulates FABP5 in human keratinocytes and reduces pustule formation in a mouse model of high fat diet-induced folliculitis. Altogether, these findings indicate that altered lipogenesis, retinoid signaling, and keratinocyte differentiation are key features of acne, and nominate AP-1 and FABP5 as potential novel therapeutic targets.

We here performed transcriptomics analysis of pretreatment specimens and identified IFITM3 as a gene specifically upregulated in tumors that develop early resistance to osimertinib. Immunohistochemistry confirmed patients with IFITM3-positive tumors experienced a shorter progression-free survival. Spatial transcriptomics and other analyses further revealed that IFITM3 expression was increased in response to cytokines derived from the tumor microenvironment (TME) during osimertinib treatment. IFITM3 was found to promote the development of osimertinib resistance through interaction with MET and activation of the AKT pathway. Furthermore, combined treatment with a MET inhibitor suppressed the development of osimertinib resistance in a mouse model. Our findings thus reveal that upregulation of IFITM3 represents a previously unrecognized mechanism of osimertinib resistance, and they suggest that targeting the IFITM3-MET axis may improve treatment outcomes.

We overcame these challenges by achieving necessary resolution and context through the application of complimentary genomics, pathology and machine learning approaches to characterize primary untreated tumors from 39 patients. We capture 340K spatial low-bulk and 530K spatial single-cell transcriptomes and observe a spectrum of classical-to-basal tumor subtypes present within all patients. We find each subtype has distinct regulators, stromal neighborhoods, microenvironment, extracellular matrix and histology corresponding to multiple immunosuppressive and therapy resistance mechanisms. We define key tumor heterogeneity features including the presence of mixed KRAS mutations and tertiary lymphoid structures; identifying biomarkers that distinguish the latter from lymph nodes. Lastly, leveraging patient, cell and mouse data, we determine which aspects of tumor biology are recapitulated in bulk datasets and reductionist models.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：leukemia、metabolic、resistance
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Junji Ikeda ; Hiroyoshi KunimotoSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with high PRDM16 expression frequently experience induction failure and have a poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these clinical features are elusive. We found that murine AML cells transformed by MLL::AF9 fusion and oncogenic short-isoform Prdm16 overexpression (hereafter, MF9/sPrdm16) exhibited resistance to cytarabine (AraC), but not to anthracycline, both in vitro and in vivo. Intriguingly, MF9/sPrdm16 cells displayed a gene expression signature of high oxidative phosphorylation (OxPHOS) and increased mitochondrial respiration. The inhibition of mitochondrial respiration with metformin or tigecycline abrogated AraC resistance in MF9/sPrdm16 cells via an energetic shift toward low OxPHOS status. Furthermore, sPrdm16 upregulated c-Myc and the glutamine transporter Slc1a5, activating TCA cycle and glutaminolysis. Of note, both OxPHOS and MYC-target gene signatures were significantly enriched in AML patient samples with high PRDM16 expression. Together, we showed that PRDM16 overexpression activates mitochondrial respiration through metabolic reprogramming via c-MYC-SLC1A5-Glutaminolysis axis, thereby conferring AraC resistance on AML cells. These results suggest that targeting mitochondrial respiration might be a novel treatment strategy to overcome chemoresistance in AML patients with high PRDM16 expression.

Radiation therapy has an immunomodulatory (immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory) role. The nature of the effects would depend on the total dose, dose per fraction, dose delivery method and treatment length. It is well-known that conventional fractionation schemes (2 Gy per fraction during several weeks) are mainly immunosuppressive and that hypofractionation tips the balance towards immune stimulation. However, the use of hypofractionation is restricted in bulky tumours, i.e. gliomas, due to the high risk of toxicity. Therefore, finding new strategies leading to more favourable immune responses while reducing normal tissue toxicities could be a game-changer. This is the case of proton minibeam radiation therapy (pMBRT). However, its immunomodulatory effects are not fully understood. To explore this, we conducted an in-depth characterization of the immune response to a curative dose of pMBRT in a preclinical orthotopic rat model of glioblastoma. Our findings revealed a close association between pMBRT and the immune response. pMBRT increased lymphocyte density in tumors more effectively than conventional proton therapy. Single-cell transcriptomics identified several immune cell types and unique transcriptional changes in tumor immune cells post-pMBRT, including increased antibody production, chemotactic cytokine expression, and interferon responses. These results underscore the critical role of adaptive immunity, specifically T cells, in pMBRT's mechanism. The potential of pMBRT to trigger an anti-tumor immune response in a single radiotherapy session with minimal damage to healthy tissue makes it a promising candidate for future clinical trials and radio-immunotherapy combinations.

- 📝 **描述**：Secret hovertext: 背景 需要更深入理解小细胞肺癌（SCLC）中针对免疫治疗的治疗敏感性差异。方法 我们通过对 159 名未治疗患者的肿瘤组织样本进行整合分子表征，利用遗传、表观遗传、转录和蛋白质组分析，对多种生物学相关标志物（包括转录亚型定义蛋白）进行免疫组化学染色，以及多重免疫荧光空间免疫分析，探索了 SCLC 的异质性。结果 多组学分析证实神经内分泌和非神经内分泌亚型之间存在高度异质性。甲基组学分析确定了四个甲基组簇，可能增强亚型预测、预后及亚型演化的纵向监测。免疫组化分析显示非神经内分泌亚型中 MHC-I 表达较高，这些亚型在化疗中加入免疫治疗具有最大潜在益处;与神经内分泌亚型及免疫性冷性肿瘤微环境相关的高 DLL3 表达。多重免疫荧光显示 MHC-I 与高 MHC-I 表达 SCLC 肿瘤微环境中免疫细胞的空间排列和表型特征相关，为 MHC-I 作为免疫治疗反应潜在生物标志物提供了机制依据。结论 这一多模态剖析分析进一步揭示了
