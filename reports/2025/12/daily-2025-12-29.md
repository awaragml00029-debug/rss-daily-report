**1.** **GSE304453 组织再生中的 3D 基因组组织：长程染色质环的功能需求 [RNA-seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：RNA-seq、genome
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Palmira Llorens-Giralt ; Carlos Camilleri-Robles ; Leo Zuber ; Jenisha Khadka ; Maria Marti-Marimon ; Florenci Serras ; Maria C Gambetta ; Marc A Marti-Renom ; Montserrat CorominasSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Drosophila melanogasterThe three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays a fundamental role in gene expression regulation. However, little is known about how transcriptional responses are influenced by changes in genome architecture during tissue regeneration. Here, we used Hi-C to profile 3D chromatin conformation during Drosophila wing imaginal disc regeneration. We found that, although compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) are largely maintained, regeneration is accompanied by reduced compartmentalization and increased boundary insulation. Notably, we identified three long-range chromatin loops with increased contact frequency during regeneration. Precise deletion of their anchors demonstrated that these loops are essential for proper disc regeneration but dispensable for normal wing development. Furthermore, disruption of any of these loops resulted in convergent changes in both gene expression and H3K4me1 3D environment, suggesting their coordinated activity during regeneration. These findings provide functional evidence that 3D genome architecture actively contributes to the regenerative process.

**3.** **GSE269417 单胚胎总RNA测序，用于绘制母源SETDB1对2细胞和8细胞转录组的影响**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：sequencing、transcriptome
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Piroska E Szabó ; Tie-Bo Zeng ; Zhen FuSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusEmbryos with maternal mutation of the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 die before implantation. We tested the role of maternal SETDB1 in the timely processes of the preimplantation stage embryo. Using single embryo total RNA sequencing from 2-cell and 8-cell embryos, we found that maternal SETDB1 is required for switching off maternal transcripts by the 2-cell stage, minor ZGA transcripts by the 2-cell stage, and major ZGA transcripts by the 8-cell stage. By timely extinguishing of endogenous retroviruses, oocyte-specific ERVL-MaLRs, many oocyte-specific genes, MERVLs, MERVL LTR-driven chimeric transcripts and ZGA genes as well as KRAB ZF genes, maternal SETDB1 secures the proper transition from totipotency to pluripotency.

**5.** **GSE314908 Chip-seq 数据用于 FGFR3 驱动的基因调控网络分析，揭示了 p63 在腔内膀胱肿瘤中的促肿瘤作用。**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：ChIP-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Isabelle Bernard-Pierrot ; Xiang-Yu Meng ; Lilia Estrada-Virrueta ; Guerric Gilbert ; Helene Neyret-KahnSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensFGFR3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3) is one of the most frequently altered genes in bladder cancer, primarily through activating mutations that drive oncogenesis and are enriched in luminal tumors. However, the underlying gene regulatory network (GRN) remains poorly characterized. Here, we inferred an FGFR3-mutated GRN using a bottom-up bioinformatics approach, integrating transcriptomic data from bladder cancer cell lines, FGFR3-mutated tumors, and FGFR3-perturbation experiments in human and mouse models. Using CRISPR-Cas9 screen public data, we identified transcription factors (TFs) from this GRN that regulate the viability of FGFR3-mutated cells, with a focus on p63 (TP63). We showed that FGFR3 activation upregulates p63 in patient-derived xenografts and cell lines, while single-cell RNA sequencing revealed heterogeneous p63 activation associated with basal differentiation. Functional studies, including TP63 knock-down in FGFR3-dependent in vitro and in vivo models and RNA-seq along with p63 ChIP-seq, demonstrated that p63 directly promotes cell proliferation and migration, and uncovered a positive feedback loop between FGFR3 and p63. Together, these findings identified p63 as a pro-tumorigenic regulator in FGFR3 mutated tumors despite their luminal differentiation and provide a detailed FGFR3-driven GRN, offering insights into FGFR3-induced oncogenic dependency and potential strategies to circumvent resistance to FGFR inhibitors.

**8.** **GSE271578 动力学单细胞RNA测序分析揭示老年宿主流感病毒感染后肺部恢复受阻的免疫机制**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：immune
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Jie Sun ; Yue WuSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusAging is a major risk factor for host morbidity and mortality upon acute respiratory virus infections. To better elucidate the immune determinants of viral pathogenesis during aging, we conducted a time-course single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and high-dimensional flow cytometry analysis on the pulmonary responses against influenza infection in young or aged mice. Notably, aged mice exhibited decreased populations of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and dendritic cells (DCs), alongside an increase in monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMs) and interstitial macrophages (IMs), which last weeks after acute viral infection. Additionally, there was enhanced accumulation of respiratory adaptive immune cell cells including tissue resident helper CD4 T cells (TRHs), CD8 tissue resident memory cells (TRMs) and a unique B cell population resembling age-associated B cells. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) comparing lung transcriptomes of young and aged mice across time points highlighted persistent type I and type interferon signaling in aged hosts, especially in the macrophage population. Interestingly, inhibiting interferon signaling in aged mice after viral clearance led to ameliorated long-term sequelae, along with a decrease in IM and TRH populations. Our findings suggest that IFNα/γ signaling, particularly in MoM/IM, is pivotal in the development of long-term sequelae following acute respiratory infections in aged hosts.

- 📝 **描述**：Stanford scientists have uncovered how mRNA COVID-19 vaccines can very rarely trigger heart inflammation in young men — and how that risk might be reduced.

**3.** **癌细胞依赖于一种危险的DNA修复技巧**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer
- 📝 **描述**：Researchers have discovered how cells activate a last-resort DNA repair system when severe damage strikes. When genetic tangles overwhelm normal repair pathways, cells flip on a fast but error-prone emergency fix that helps them survive. Some cancer cells rely heavily on this backup system, even though it makes their DNA more unstable. Blocking this process could expose a powerful new way to target tumors.
