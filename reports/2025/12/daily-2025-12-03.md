**1.** ⭐ **GSE309664 线粒体DNA耗竭神经元细胞的全局转录组变化揭示了阿尔茨海默病相关通路的变化**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：Alzheimer、Neuronal、pathway
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Blaise W Menta ; Emily Schueddig ; Amol Ranjan ; Yanming Li ; Heather M Wilkins ; Dong Pei ; Russell H SwerdlowSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensBackground: Mitochondrial dysfunction, a prominent feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), could represent a cause or consequence of the disease. Objective: We determined the extent to which mitochondrial dysfunction due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion induces transcription changes that link to AD phenomena. Methods: We performed a transcriptomic survey of human neuronal SH SY5Y and NTERA 2/NT2 mtDNA-depleted (ρ0) and intact (ρ+) cell lines. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between SH-SY5Y or NT2 ρ0 and ρ+ cells were identified using edgeR, and we used the Equivalent Change Index (ECI) approach to quantify concordant DEG behavior across the cell lines. Gene set enrichment and over representation analysis (GSEA; ORA) were used to determine impact on the KEGG Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative disease pathways, ascertain pathway and term enrichment in the Reactome and Gene Ontology databases, and generate activation z-scores in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) database. Results: Relative to their ρ+ comparators, ρ0 lines differentially expressed >75% of their genes, and >20% more than doubled or halved expression. The KEGG Alzheimer’s pathway was significantly enriched, and ECI-identified genes ranked the Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, ALS, and Huntington’s KEGG pathways among the most enriched gene sets. There was broad enrichment of pathways and terms relating to AD phenomena, which reflected lipid, insulin signaling, inflammation/immune response, synapse, endosome/endocytosis, RNA, and proteostasis biology. Conclusion: In neuronal cell lines, mitochondrial dysfunction due to mtDNA depletion alters gene expression in ways that recapitulate or predictably promote AD molecular phenomena.

**2.** ⭐ **GSE308273 合成齐墩果烷三萜类化合物可抑制肿瘤生长并促进抗肿瘤免疫反应，且该作用独立于癌症KEAP1突变状态**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Christopher J Occhiuto ; Jessica A Moerland ; Karen T Liby ; Ana S LealSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusKEAP1 negatively regulates the cytoprotective factor NRF2 and is commonly inactivated in lung cancer cells. Loss of function KEAP1 mutations in cancer cells contribute to NRF2 activation and tumor immune evasion through immunosuppression and drug resistance. Counterintuitively, treatment with synthetic oleanane triterpenoids, potent NRF2 activa-tors, reduces preclinical tumor burden. This suggests the functional target of these drugs in cancer models is not the cancer cells but another tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) cell population. The anti-tumor potential of cells within the TIME, particularly macrophages, is potentiated by triterpenoid treatment in cancers with wild-type KEAP1 status. As KEAP1-mutant cancers show reduced tumor immune responses, triterpenoid-mediated immune stimulation may particularly benefit these cases, but this has not been investigated. To characterize the immunomodulatory effects of triterpenoids in KEAP1-mutant lung cancer, we studied tumor-educated bone marrow-derived macrophages (TE-BMDMs) and lung cancer models treated with the triterpenoids CDDO-Me or omaveloxolone. RNA-sequencing of TE-BMDMs cultured in KEAP1 KO compared to WT cancer-conditioned media had enhanced tumor-promoting phenotypes which reversed with CDDO-Me treatment. Similarly, subcutaneous KEAP1 KO tumors were larger and more immune-suppressed compared to WT tumors. Both CDDO-Me and omaveloxolone reduced tumor burden and improved immune cell phenotypes within the TIME, independent of KEAP1 mutational status.

**3.** ⭐ **GSE308945 组蛋白甲基转移酶 KMT2D 是去势抵抗性前列腺癌谱系可塑性和治疗反应的关键介质 [FOSL1 ChIP-Seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、ChIP-seq、histone
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Eneda Toska ; Wouter Karthaus ; Srushti Kittane ; Erik Ladewig ; Taibo Li ; Yangzhenyu GaoSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensCastration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is largely dependent on the androgen receptor (AR) for growth and often exhibits hyperactive PI3K signaling, most frequently due to PTEN loss. Therapeutic pressure from anti-AR therapies can induce trans-differentiation toward an AR-independent phenotype. Recently, different subtypes of AR-independent CRPC have been redefined, with the stem cell-like (SCL) subtype emerging as one of the most prevalent. Elucidation of the epigenetic mechanisms controlling the maintenance of these distinct CRPC cell states could pave the way for effective combinatorial therapies for CRPC. In this study, we identified a key role for the histone methyltransferase KMT2D in establishing the chromatin competence necessary for the recruitment of AR and FOXA1 transcription factors (TFs) that are essential for the AR transcriptional output in AR-dependent CRPC cell lines, patient derived organoids, and patient samples. Unexpectedly, KMT2D maintained the identity of the AR-low CRPC-SCL subtype and controlled activity of AP-1 TFs such as FOSL1, which acts as a master regulator of this subtype. Single cell transcriptomics and chromatin assays underscored the role of KMT2D in sustaining a mixed lineage cell state via AP-1 and FOXA1. The combined suppression of PI3K/AKT and KMT2D reduced cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells and patient-derived organoids in both CRPC-AR and CRPC-SCL subtypes. Altogether, these results unveil KMT2D as a major mediator of the epigenetic landscape in subtype-specific CRPC, contributing to tumor growth and therapeutic response.
