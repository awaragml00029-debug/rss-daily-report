Our study investigates the immuno-metabolic landscape of omental metastases to identify therapeutic targets. Using patient-derived explants (PDEs), we demonstrate that lipid-rich omental environments preserve effector T cell function, while lipid processing in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) induces oxidative stress and immune suppression. Targeting lipid metabolism via CCR5 inhibition (e.g., maraviroc) or anti-CD36 treatment reprograms TAMs, restores T cell activity, and enhances anti-tumor immunity. These findings reveal a metabolic-inflammatory axis that can be modulated to improve ICB outcomes in EOC.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：genome、methylation
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Alexis Overs ; Jean-Paul Feugeas ; Zohair Selmani ; Paul Peixoto ; Eric Hervouet ; Chloé Molimard ; Laurent Arnould ; Frédéric Bibeau ; Jules DurandSeries Type : Methylation profiling by arrayOrganism : Homo sapiensIntroduction: The dynamics of colorectal epigenetics during early carcinogenesis remain undocumented. In this study, we explore the DNA methylation dynamics in colorectal cancer oncogenesis from non-tumor colon tissues to low-grade, high-grade adenoma and adenocarcinoma. Methods: The methylome of 13 low-grade and 19 high-grade colorectal adenomas was determined using the EPIC v1 Human Methylation Beadchip. These methylation profiles were complemented with the methylomes of 206 non-tumor colon and 24 colon adenocarcinomas from GSE149282, GSE132804 series and the HCMI study. Differentially methylated CpG were identified by Student's t-test and used to monitor the evolution of the colon methylome during carcinogenesis. The differentially methylated promoters were used to infer the associated biological process using gene ontology. Results: 4.9% of the colon methylome is significantly altered (p < 10-4) during carcinogenesis with two thirds corresponding to DNA demethylation. 56.6% of the methylation changes occurs at the transition from non-tumor colon tissues to low-grades adenomas. 18.2% of the DNA methylation changes are transitory during low-grade and/or high-grade adenomas. The biological pathways sensory perception of odor and stimulus were early unmethylated, nervous system development and homophilic cell adhesion were early methylated, and chemical synaptic transmission and cell adhesion were transiently methylated. Conclusion: This study provides insight into the dynamics of colonic epigenetics during carcinogenesis, with early DNA methylation changes in the low-grade adenomas associated with transient DNA methylation changes. However, the causality of these changes remains to be elucidated.

**10.** **GSE311611 同时靶向 KRAS 和 CDK4 可协同诱导胰腺癌细胞持久生长停滞**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、KRAS
- 📝 **描述**：Series Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusMutant Ras oncoproteins, particularly KRAS, are among the most prevalent drivers of cancer. Small-molecule KRAS inhibitors have emerged as promising cancer therapeutics, yet resistance development remains a major hurdle. To overcome this challenge, we explored rational combination strategies aimed at enhancing therapeutic efficacy and durability. We show that the KRAS-G12C inhibitor Sotorasib synergizes with the CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib to eliminate pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells and organoids harboring KRAS-G12C mutations. This synergy was especially pronounced following drug washout, indicating a durable cellular response. Similar synergistic effects were observed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Additionally, the KRAS-G12D inhibitor MRTX1133 cooperated with Palbociclib to suppress KRAS-G12D-mutant PDAC cells. Mechanistically, the combinations induced sustained cell cycle arrest, marked by reduced RB phosphorylation, decreased E2F1 expression, and increased levels of CDKN1B/p27. Deletion of CDKN1B largely reversed the growth-inhibitory effect, highlighting its essential role in mediating the observed synergy. In an orthotopic, immunocompetent mouse model of PDAC, MRTX1133 significantly delayed tumor growth and extended survival; however, despite its ability to suppress RB phosphorylation, Palbociclib failed to enhance these effects. This might be due to increased tumor vascularization upon Palbociclib treatment, as revealed by single cell RNA sequencing. In summary, our findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of enhancing cell cycle restriction point activation in KRAS inhibitor-based therapies, while emphasizing the importance of precisely adjusting the drug combinations to the in vivo situation.
