- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、immune、tumor microenvironment、macrophage
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Tina Kwok ; Jessica N LancasterSeries Type : Expression profiling by arrayOrganism : Mus musculusImmunotherapy combinations can improve patient outcomes, yet the interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME) that drive therapeutic synergy are poorly understood. Tumor establishment drives monocyte recruitment and differentiation into tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which have essential roles in coordinating immune responses and are thus attractive targets for therapeutic modulation. In a murine model of combination anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 checkpoint blockade, tumor control was associated with increased infiltration of CD8+ T-cells and M1-like repolarization of TAMs. Live-cell imaging of the tumor microenvironment revealed close contacts between tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells and TAMs, in which the extent of the contact interfaces increased with combination immunotherapy. Treatment with anti-PD-L1 was able to increase macrophage expression of pro-inflammatory factors and phagocytic activity, suggesting a role for TAMs in reactivating CD8+ T-cells in the TME. However, co-treatment with anti-PD-1 was ultimately necessary for tumor control, indicating the need for combination targeting of the TME.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Hedda M Guevara-Nieto ; Carlos A Orozco ; Rafael Parra Medina ; Jone Garai ; Jovanny Zabaleta ; Liliana Lopez-Kleine ; Alba L CombitaSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensNeoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a critical component of breast cancer treatment, but the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify transcriptomic changes associated with NAC resistance across four breast cancer subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B/HER2-positive, Luminal B/HER2-negative, and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). RNA-seq analysis was performed on paired pre- and post-NAC breast cancer samples from 35 non-responders. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and functional enrichment analyses were conducted. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed to identify hub genes. Tumor microenvironment (TME) infiltration was estimated using deconvolution algorithms. The results revealed distinct gene expression profiles between pre- and post-NAC samples, with FOS and NR4A1 being common DEGs across all subtypes. Enriched pathways varied among subtypes, including signal transduction, estrogen biosynthesis, extracellular matrix organization, dendritic cell activation, and B cell activation. TME analysis showed increased infiltration of specific immune cell populations after NAC, including CD4 memory T cells, regulatory T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells, varying by subtype. These findings suggest that NAC modulates gene expression, cellular activity, and TME interactions, potentially contributing to treatment resistance. Understanding the molecular determinants of NAC resistance is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies and improving outcomes for breast cancer patients.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Xinlan Lu ; Yungang Xu ; Min QiangSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensLiver cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, and its high aggressiveness and recurrence rate pose a major challenge. Metabolic reprogramming is one of the cancer hallmarks and allows tumor cells to adapt to drastic changes, supporting their rapid growth, survival, and proliferation under various conditions. The metabolic reprogramming of several amino acids within tumors profoundly affects the function of the immune cells. Furthermore, arginine and various other amino acids are now being widely studied as potential targets for anti-tumor therapy. However, the role of lysine metabolic reprogramming in tumors remains largely unexplored. This study aims to reveal the relationship between lysine metabolism reprogramming and the prognosis of liver cancer, the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), and responses to immunotherapy through multi-omics analysis. Combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed a significant downregulation of lysine metabolism in tumor tissues against normal tissue adjacent to the tumor from liver cancer patients. Subsequently, we constructed a lysine metabolism score (LM score) based on nine lysine metabolic genes to stratify liver cancer patients into high and low lysine metabolism subtypes. The LM score exhibited potential in predicting both survival and immunotherapy response in liver cancer. Furthermore, significant differences were observed in prognosis, clinical staging, TIME, and immunotherapy outcomes between the subtypes with low and high lysine metabolism. In the subtype of low lysine metabolism, an immunosuppressive TIME predominated, correlating with poorer patient survival and anti-tumor immune responses. In conclusion, we uncover that disturbed lysine metabolism promotes the formation of the immunosuppressive TIME, thereby inducing immunotherapy resistance and advancing liver cancer progression. This provides an effective theoretical reference for elucidating the mechanism of immunotherapy resistance in liver cancer and seeking new therapeutic strategies.

**5.** ⭐ **GSE270678 不同阶段的三级淋巴结构表现出不同的抗肿瘤免疫力 [空间转录组学]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：immunity、spatial、spatial transcriptomics、transcriptomics
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Zemin Zhang ; Sen GaoSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Homo sapiensThe tumour microenvironment (TME) is a focal point in cancer immunotherapy: its cellular composition and spatial organisation, especially the distribution of lymphocytes, can affect the clinical outcomes of cancer patients. In addition, the function of a cell differs depending on its spatial location and interaction with neighbouring cells. Here, by integrating single-cell transcriptomics with spatial transcriptomics, we survey how the spatial distribution of different cell types varies across diverse histological regions of gastric cancer. Notably, tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), a tissue architecture harbouring lymphocytes more than any other region within the TME, possess great potential in modulating anti-tumorigenic immunity by elevating an array of genes (FDCSP and CCL19) principally involved in lymphocyte recruitment and activation. Our findings advance the understanding of TLSs in contributing to anti-tumorigenic immunity in a spatially resolved context, which could be further leveraged as a predictive marker for immunotherapy response.

One promising approach involves engineering T cells to specifically target proteins uniquely overexpressed in tumors, thereby controlling tumor growth without toxicity to healthy tissues. Mesothelin (Msln) contributes to the malignant and invasive phenotype in ovarian cancer and has limited expression in healthy cells, making it a candidate immunotherapy target. Our previous results in a mouse model of ovarian cancer demonstrated that T cells engineered to express a T cell receptor (TCR) targeting Msln (TCRMSLN) mediated therapeutic activity, delaying tumor growth and prolonging mouse survival. However, inhibitory ligands expressed in the tumor microenvironment (TME) interacted with inhibitory receptors on activated T cells, suppressing antitumor function. We hypothesized combining engineered T cells with checkpoint blockade would enhance T cell function in the TME and improve therapeutic efficacy, but administration of mono-specific antibodies targeting individual inhibitory pathways had no significant impact on T cell efficacy. By contrast, the combination of PD-1, Tim-3 and Lag-3 blockade with engineered T cells significantly improved T cell function and overall animal survival relative to treatment with antibody alone or TCRMSLN with singlet or doublet antibody combinations. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed TCRMSLN T cells treated with the triplet antibody combination increased expression of genes involved in interferon responses and metabolic function, and reduced expression of genes associated with exhaustion. These results suggest that strategies to disrupt multiple inhibitory pathways simultaneously may be necessary for improved adoptive T cell therapy efficacy in patients.

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、sequencing、genome
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Yunjie Shi ; Ling Liu ; Weiliang Hou ; Hao wangSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Mus musculusThis study provides a comprehensive genomic characterization of Streptococcus oralis CRC211, a novel bacterial strain isolated from colorectal tumor tissue, through whole-genome sequencing and comparative analysis. The high-quality assembled genome (15.03 Mb, 40.94% GC content) contains 2 prophage regions spanning 160.5 kb, which may facilitate horizontal transfer of virulence genes. Functional annotation identified 3,674 genes, with significant enrichment in metabolic pathways (amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism) and virulence factors (116 genes in VFDB), including adhesins and biofilm-associated proteins that likely promote tumor colonization. Comparative genomic analysis revealed CRC211 shares 92.29% average nucleotide identity with reference S. oralis strains, while pan-genome analysis demonstrated an open genome structure with 1,222 conserved core genes. The strain also carries 75 antimicrobial resistance genes, suggesting potential clinical relevance. Notably, the genomic profile indicates adaptations for nutrient acquisition and immune evasion in the tumor microenvironment. These findings establish CRC211 as a CRC-associated strain with distinct genomic features that may contribute to tumor progression, providing crucial insights for future investigations into its oncogenic mechanisms and potential applications in microbiota-based diagnostics or therapeutics for colorectal cancer.

**10.** ⭐ **GSE293361 抗癌治疗诱导的KEAP1-NRF2系统基因改变导致头颈部鳞状细胞癌对顺铂产生耐药性**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、carcinoma、resistance
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Yuki Nakayama ; Keiko Taguchi ; Masayuki YamamotoSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensCisplatin (CDDP) is widely used in the chemotherapy of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but its efficacy is limited in recurrent cases. This highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the CDDP resistance. We hypothesized that chemoradiotherapy with CDDP may induce hyperactivation of NRF2, contributing to CDDP resistance. To investigate this, we first examined NRF2 expression in clinical HNSCC samples by immunohistochemistry and assessed the occurrence of somatic mutations in KEAP1 and NRF2 genes using public databases. We found that high NRF2 expression was associated with poorer prognosis compared to low expression. Furthermore, recurrent HNSCC cases following post-operative chemoradiotherapy exhibited higher NRF2 accumulation than their corresponding primary tumors. Database analysis also revealed occurrence of frequent mutations in KEAP1 associated with CDDP treatment. We then assessed the role of NRF2 in HNSCC malignancy utilizing seven parent (P) HNSCC cell lines and their CDDP-resistant (CR) derivatives. Of these P-CR pairs, three CR cell lines exhibited NRF2 upregulation. Two of them carried KEAP1 mutations and one carried an NRF2 mutation, both present in P and CR lines. These NRF2-high CR lines showed elevated expression of NRF2 target gene and activation of xenobiotic metabolism and reactive oxygen species pathways. Treatment with mitomycin C (MMC), known for its synthetic lethal activity against NRF2-activated cancer cells, showed strong cytotoxicity in NRF2-high CR lines. These findings indicate that the KEAP1-NRF2 system plays a critical role in the development of CDDP resistance and that MMC represents a promising therapeutic option for NRF2-high/CDDP-resistant HNSCC.
