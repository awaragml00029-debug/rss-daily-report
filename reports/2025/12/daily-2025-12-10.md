Spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed the most pronounced gene expression changes in the epidermis, peaking at 24 hours post-irradiation. While CD45⁺ immune cells showed differential expression of chemokines, cytokines, and acute-phase proteins, cytokeratin⁺ epidermal cells upregulated genes related to cellular stress and damage (e.g., Usp19, Adam25), as well as structural remodeling and apoptosis (e.g., Krt18, Phlda1). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) conducted 12 hours after UVR exposure identified 4,849 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with the epidermis and endothelial cells showing the highest DEG counts. Pathway analysis of upregulated genes in the epidermis revealed enrichment in VEGF, HIPPO, complement, IL-6, and apoptosis signaling pathways. In endothelial cells, UVR induced expression of multiple chemokines and cytokines. Notably, receptor-ligand analysis highlighted endothelial cells as key targets of CXCL chemokines and complement component C3. In fibroblasts, UVR triggered upregulation of inflammatory activation markers (Osmr, Cux1) alongside genes associated with glucose metabolism (Hif1a, Pkm). Cross-species comparison of UVR-responsive DEGs between mice and humans revealed strong concordance, particularly in TGF-β and TNF-associated pathways.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、immune、T cell、pathway
- 📝 **描述**：Contributor : Yahui DingSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusSOAT1 (sterol O-acyltransferase 1) serves as a cancer stem cell-specific immune checkpoint that facilitates trans-cellular signaling through the release of 20-Hydroxycholesterol (20-OHC) and subsequent activation of GPR132 on regulatory T cells (Tregs). This pathway plays a crucial role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment and can significantly influence the balance between immune activation and suppression. In the context of cancer, SOAT1 is instrumental in regulating the cholesterol metabolism of cancer stem cells. When SOAT1 is inhibited, there is an increase in the secretion of 20-OHC by tumor cells. This oxysterol not only functions as a signaling molecule but also acts as a ligand that binds to GPR132, a G protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed on immune cells, including Tregs. This binding triggers a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways that ultimately enhances the immunosuppressive functions of Tregs. Mechanistically, the activation of GPR132 by 20-OHC leads to downstream signaling events that may involve pathways such as JAK-STAT and PKC signaling, promoting the development and survival of Tregs while enabling them to exert their immunosuppressive effects within the tumor microenvironment. This results in the downregulation of effector T cell activities and impairs the maturation and activation of dendritic cells (DCs), which are pivotal for effective anti-tumor immune responses. The presence of Tregs, particularly in elevated frequencies within tumors, can contribute to an immunosuppressive environment that protects cancer cells from immune-mediated destruction. Thus, the SOAT1-20OHC-GPR132 axis represents a critical mechanism through which cancer cells can evade immune surveillance. By controlling cholesterol metabolism through SOAT1, tumors can manipulate the availability of 20-OHC, amplifying the immunosuppressive capacity of Tregs and facilitating an environment conducive to tumor growth and progression. Targeting SOAT1 and the associated 20-OHC signaling pathway may offer a promising therapeutic strategy to neutralize Treg-mediated immunosuppression. Inhibiting SOAT1 not only disrupts the tumor's ability to produce 20-OHC but also potentially reprograms the immune landscape, promoting a more activated and effective anti-tumor immune response.

**6.** ⭐ **GSE298654 利用双光子激发荧光（TPEF）、质谱和RNA测序分析研究癌症治疗诱导衰老细胞的代谢特征**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、metabolic、sequencing
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Silvia Ghislanzoni ; Federica Padelli ; Alessia Bertolotti ; Antonino Belfiore ; Matteo Niero ; Arianna Bresci ; Silvia Betti ; Andrea Masella ; Dario Polli ; Luca Agnelli ; Italia BongarzoneSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensBackground. Despite major advances in cancer therapies, treatment failure remains a significant issue for a subset of patients due to therapy resistance and tumour recurrence. A key contributor to these failures is therapy-induced senescence, wherein damaged cells enter a stable cell cycle arrest while remaining metabolically active, contributing to chronic inflammation and cancer relapse. These senescent cells can promote chronic inflammation and disease relapse. However, the heterogeneous nature of senescence complicates its detection and therapeutic targeting. Methods. We employed a multimodal approach to profile metabolic alterations in senescent cancer cells. Senescent cells were induced either by doxorubicin or γ-irradiation, both widely employed strategies in anti-cancer treatment, across three human cancer cell lines: MCF7, HeLa, and TPC-1. Mitochondrial dysfunction was assessed through MitoTracker and JC-1 staining. Two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy enabled label-free imaging of mitochondrial coenzymes NAD(P)H and FAD. Lipidomic changes were analyzed using MALDI mass spectrometry imaging following lipid extraction and matrix application. Additionally, transcriptomic profiling via RNA sequencing was performed on control, senescent, and engulfing-senescent MCF7 cells. Bioinformatic analyses included differential gene expression, gene set enrichment analysis, and pathway analysis using GO, KEGG, and Reactome databases Results. Across all models, senescent cells exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction, marked by altered NAD(P)H and FAD distribution and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Two-photon excited fluorescence imaging confirmed a broader intracellular redistribution of mitochondrial coenzymes. MALDI analyses revealed consistent lipid remodeling, particularly involving cardiolipin precursors such as PG(18:1/18:1) and PG(18:1/22:6). Transcriptomic profiling of senescent MCF7 cells revealed that a previously observed engulfing subpopulation is marked by enhanced oxidative metabolism and increased lipid catabolism, suggestive of an engulfing phenotype. Conclusion. Our findings delineate both conserved and divergent metabolic features across se...
