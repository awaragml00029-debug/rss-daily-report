- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、dendritic cell、antigen、RNA-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Nadine Fournier ; Yahya Mohammadzadeh ; Michele De PalmaSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusEffective anti-tumor immunity requires dendritic cells (DCs) to internalize, process and present tumor antigens to T cells. Adoptive transfer of DCs loaded ex vivo with tumor antigens has been shown to stimulate anti-tumor immunity in patients with cancer, but clinical responses have been mixed. To address limitations of traditional DC-based therapies, we constructed and functionally screened a panel of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) optimized for expression and activity in DCs. Through this screening, we identified key functional components that informed the design of an inducible platform centered on an instructive chimeric antigen receptor (iCAR). This platform enables the DCs to (i) recognize a surface molecule present on cancer cells or their extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as GD2 and HER2, thereby promoting the acquisition of tumor-derived material that contains putative tumor antigens; (ii) undergo immunostimulatory activation to prime antigen-specific T cells via both cross-dressing and cross-presentation; and (iii) transactivate the expression of a therapeutic gene (IL-12) in response to antigen uptake. The iCAR converted melanoma-derived EVs from immune-suppressive to stimulatory cues for DCs. Moreover, systemic administration of iCAR-DCs enhanced antigen-specific T cells, expanded low-frequency T cell clonotypes, and delayed tumor growth in immunotherapy-resistant melanoma models without the need for ex vivo antigen loading or cell maturation. iCAR-DCs provide a platform for antigen-agnostic cancer immunotherapy that integrates antigen uptake with programmable DC activation.

Lysine demethylase 4C (Kdm4C) is one of the chromatin-modifying proteins frequently overexpressed across multiple solid cancers and is linked to chromatin instability, increased cell proliferation, and enhanced stem cell-like behavior. We observed upregulation of Kdm4C protein in a panel of human PDAC cell lines and patient samples compared to non-neoplastic controls. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of KDM4C in human and murine PDAC cells reduced proliferation, clonogenicity and increased survival of orthotopically implanted murine PDAC allografts. Transcriptomic and proteomics analyses revealed that loss of Kdm4C in both human and murine PDAC cell lines was associated with reduction of activated phospho-Erk, a pivotal effector downstream of mutant Ras. Using proximity labeling, we identified the histone deacetylase SIRT1 as a novel interacting protein with Kdm4C via the latter’s Tudor reader domain. SIRT1-mediated deacetylation leads to repression of downstream targets, including the dual specificity phosphatase DUSP2, which is known to inactivate Erk via dephosphorylation. In vitro propagation of KDM4C-null PDAC lines eventually led to adaptation and restitution of Erk signaling via compensatory upregulation of other KDM4 family members. To bypass this genetic compensation, we tested a preclinical pan-KDM4 inhibitor TACH107 and confirmed its efficacy in in vitro and in vivo PDAC models including those resistant to the covalent KRASG12D inhibitor MTRX1133. Our studies identify Kdm4C as an oncogenic molecule that sustains Erk signaling in KRAS-mutant PDAC and can be broadly targeted via small molecule inhibitors.

Excessive maternal interferon gamma (IFNγ) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) is linked to pregnancy complications, but the regulation of maternal IFNγ and IL-17 at the maternal-fetal interface (MFI) is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate a gut-placenta immune axis in pregnant mice in which the absence or perturbation of gut microbiota dysregulates maternal IFNγ and IL-17 responses at the MFI, resulting in fetal resorption. Microbiota-dependent tryptophan derivatives suppress IFNγ+ and IL-17+ T cells at the MFI by priming myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and gut-derived RORγt+ Tregs, respectively. The tryptophan derivative indole-3-carbinol, or tryptophan-metabolizing Lactobacillus murinus, rebalances the T cell response at the MFI and reduces fetal resorption in germ-free mice. Furthermore, MDSCs, RORγt+ Tregs, and microbiota-dependent tryptophan derivatives are dysregulated at the MFI in human recurrent miscarriage cases. Together, our findings identify microbiota-dependent immune tolerance mechanisms that promote fetal development.

- 🏷️ **关键词**：肿瘤、免疫
- 📝 **描述**：Secret hovertext: 目的：先前研究表明，血浆来源 ctDNA 在接受免疫检查点抑制剂治疗的癌症患者中具有生物标志物潜力。本研究探讨了 ctDNA 在接受免疫疗法治疗的晚期癌症患者队列中预测无进展和总体生存的能力。实验设计：为了表征超灵性 ctDNA 检测在这些患者管理中的潜在作用，我们进行了肿瘤全基因组测序——知情的超灵敏 ctDNA 分析——在回顾性队列（n=136）和前瞻性验证队列（n=66）中，涵盖 24 种癌症类型，均仅使用免疫检查点抑制剂或双特异性抗体或免疫性免疫药物治疗细胞联动者。结果：分析 1455 个纵向样本，我们发现 ctDNA 分子反应在治疗开始后 3 周内测量，与无进展期和总体生存期的改善相关，而任何时候的 ctDNA 清除率与放射反应和延长生存期高度相关。此外，ctDNA 动力学区分了真实进展与伪进展，并预测了接受初期进展后持续免疫治疗患者的结局。结论：本研究强调了超敏感 ctDNA

**10.** **接受 PD-1/L1 抗体及联合抗病毒预防药物治疗的肝细胞癌患者 HBV 再活化：前瞻性观察性研究**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：抗体
- 📝 **描述**：Secret hovertext: 目的：肝细胞癌（HCC）中免疫检查点抑制剂（ICIs）相关试验因 HBV 再活化对 HBV DNA 负荷有严格限制。本研究旨在比较接受 ICI 和抗病毒治疗的低或高 HBV DNA 负荷 HCC 患者的 HBV 再活化情况。患者与方法：本前瞻性观察性研究（NCT04680598）招募了接受联合抗病毒治疗并进行 ICI 治疗的 HBsAg 阳性 HCC 患者。参与者被分为 HBV DNA 低组（≤500 IU/ml）组和 HBV DNA 高组（> 500 IU/ml 组）。主要终点是 HBV 的再激活率。结果：2020 年 12 月 25 日至 2024 年 2 月 23 日期间，356 至 659 名参与者被分组为 HBV DNA 低组和高组。HBV DNA 高组中，HBeAg 阳性患者比例显著较高（24.1%对 7.0%，p < 0.001）、ALBI 等级 2-3（49.9%对 33.7%，p

**3.** **一种预防牙龈疾病而不破坏有益菌的新方法**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：bacteria、regex:bacter(ia|ial|ium)
- 📝 **描述**：Scientists are uncovering a surprising way to influence bacteria—not by killing them, but by changing how they communicate. Researchers studying oral bacteria found that disrupting chemical signals used in bacterial “conversations” can shift dental plaque toward healthier, less harmful communities. The discovery could open the door to new treatments that prevent disease by maintaining a balanced microbiome rather than wiping bacteria out entirely.

**4.** **结肠癌在年轻人中发病率激增，医生们对此感到担忧。**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer
- 📝 **描述**：Cases of colorectal cancer in younger adults are climbing worldwide, driven by lifestyle changes and inherited genetic risks. Diet, obesity, and lack of early screening are playing a major role in this shift. New genetic tests offer hope for earlier detection, but access and awareness lag behind. Health experts say urgent action is needed to reverse the trend.
