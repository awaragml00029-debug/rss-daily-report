**1.** ⭐ **GSE314254 优化的多药疗法重塑肿瘤微环境并增强微卫星稳定型结直肠癌的抗肿瘤免疫**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、cancer、immunity、tumor microenvironment
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Pablo H Lopez ; Patrycja Nowak-SliwinskaSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusFour low-dose tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)–based ODCs were evaluated in murine AKP CRC organoids, co-culture systems with tumor-associated endothelial cells and immune cells, and in vivo syngeneic models. Among these, ODCDLD1 (regorafenib, vemurafenib, erlotinib HCl, selumetinib) showed the most potent inhibition of tumor organoid viability (∼90%), promoted leukocyte infiltration in co-cultures, and significantly upregulated endothelial adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin). In vivo, ODCDLD1 reduced tumor growth comparably to oxaliplatin but with a favorable toxicity profile. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that both ODCDLD1 and oxaliplatin significantly reduced the population of proliferating cancer cells. Furthermore, ODCDLD1-based treatment recapitulated transcriptomic findings by showing a significant reduction in proliferating myofibroblasts, a key stromal component. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed that ODCDLD1, especially when combined with anti-PD-1, induced an immunologically “hot” tumor microenvironment characterized by enhanced immune cell recruitment, reduced fibroblast and stem-like cell signatures, and upregulation of endothelial markers.

**2.** ⭐ **GSE291419：基于双门控巨噬细胞-细菌激活平台的精准肿瘤免疫疗法**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、macrophage、regex:bacter(ia|ial|ium)、regex:immuno(logy|therapy|suppression)
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Lin Li ; Leyang Wu ; Zichun HuaSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusImmunotherapy based on live microorganisms has shown promise in preclinical studies, but its clinical translation has been hampered by limited efficacy and innegligible toxicity. Here, we developed M-BLAST (Macrophage-Bacteria encapsulation Lytic Autoactivated Synergistic Therapeutics), a dual-gated macrophage-mediated bacterial tumor-targeted delivery and in situ activation system. M-BLAST incorporates density-regulated virulence-enhanced attenuated Salmonella strains as the therapeutic core, thermally-controlled GSDMD-N-expressing macrophages as the delivery vector, and copper selenide, a photothermal material, as a heat-shock “primer.” Following systemic administration, localized near-infrared irradiation at the tumor site triggers macrophage pyroptosis, ensuring rapid and complete bacterial release. This disrupts the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and elicits a widespread cascading antitumor response just like a “immune bomb”, while dual-gating design of bacterial density and heat-shock ensures safety by preventing off-target activation in non-tumor regions. M-BLAST promises to enhance the therapeutic utility of living engineered bacteria for cancer while ensuring safety.

**3.** ⭐ **GSE297247 妊娠期免疫激活通过表观遗传机制对突触和神经发育通路产生产前和产后影响（ChIP-seq）**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：immune、ChIP-seq、epigenetic
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Bohan Zhu ; Gaoshan Li ; Chang LuSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusPrevious epidemiological research suggests that maternal immune activation (MIA) during early pregnancy is a significant risk factor for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring. Epigenetic factors and chromatin-related phenomena remain largely plastic during the course of prenatal and early postnatal development, allowing a dynamic impact of environmental effects on access to genes and regulatory elements. In this study, we tested the effects of maternal infection with the mouse-adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus as a MIA model. Additionally, to assess the prenatal and postnatal effects of MIA, we cross-fostered half of the neonatal mice immediately after birth.This study includes RNA-seq and ChIP-seq profiling (H3K27ac, H3K4me3) from the prefrontal cortex of MIA-exposed and control mice. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data are submitted under separate Series and linked via sample annotations.

**5.** ⭐ **GSE284605 锌指和BTB结构域包含32 (Zbtb32) 转录因子促进癌症中CD8+ T细胞的分化和功能 [ChIP-Seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、T cell、ChIP-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Birui Pan ; Ruifeng Li ; Xiaohong Zhao ; Chen DongSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusIn the tumor microenvironment (TME), “exhausted” CD8+ T cells are classified into progenitor (Tpex) and terminally exhausted (Ttex) populations. Tpex cells could be reinvigorated during immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. However, the mechanisms governing the differentiation of Tpex to Ttex remain not well understood. In this study, we identified that Zinc Finger and BTB Domain Containing 32 (Zbtb32) transcription factor, highly expressed in CD8+ Ttex subset, plays a critical role in regulating CD8+ T cells within tumors. Zbtb32, regulated by CD28 signaling, promotes the differentiation of CD8+ T cells into Ttex subset, enhancing their cytotoxicity, proliferation and anti-tumor capability. Importantly, we found a competitive DNA binding between Zbtb32 and Bcl6, another Zbtb family member promoting the Tpex program, especially in regulation of Id2 expression. Thus, our findings underscore the pivotal role of Zbtb32 in CD8+ T cell anti-tumor function, with implications in cancer immunotherapy.

**8.** **GSE297440 用于即时病毒基因组测序的微反应器系统**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：sequencing、genome
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Thomas M Hadlock ; Jacob Neice ; Chang LuSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Sus scrofa domesticusViral genome sequencing is critical for understanding viral biology, identifying strain mutations, and managing public health during pandemics. Although sequencing technologies have progressed over the years in terms of throughput and cost, a portable platform that integrates sample processing, library preparation, and sequencing remains critical for point-of-care viral sequencing that combats viral outbreaks in the field. In here, we demonstrate a semi-automated, field-deployable microreactor system to produce nanopore sequencing libraries from viral samples. The system integrates isothermal amplification, purification, and enzymatic processing within a closed-channel format, minimizing contamination risk and operational complexity. Using Senecavirus A (SVA) as a surrogate for high-consequence pathogens, we demonstrate the system’s ability to prepare sequencing libraries targeting three dispersed genomic regions comprising ~16% of the viral genome and identify single nucleotide variations with high confidence. Together with a portable nanopore sequencer, this microreactor offers a robust solution for decentralized genomic surveillance and rapid diagnostics in resource-limited or outbreak-prone environments.

**10.** **GSE295927 空间上不同的细胞和分子景观决定了三阴性乳腺癌的预后[2]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、spatially
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Kavitha Mukund ; Darya Veraksa ; David E Frankhouser ; Lixin Yang ; Jerneja Tomsic ; Raju Pillai ; Srijan Atti ; Zahra Mesrizadeh ; Daniel Schmolze ; Xio-Cheng Wu ; Mary-Anne LeBlanc ; Lucio Miele ; Augusto Ochoa ; Victoria Seewaldt ; Shankar SubramaniamSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Homo sapiens ; synthetic constructTriple-negative breast cancer is a prevalent breast cancer subtype with the lowest 5-year survival. Several factors contribute to its treatment response, but the inherent molecular and cellular tumor heterogeneity are increasingly acknowledged as crucial determinants. Here we report on the spatial and molecular heterogeneity underlying a retrospective, treatment-naïve group of women with differential prognoses (17 with >15 years survival- good prognosis (GPx) and 15 with <3 years survival-poor prognosis (PPx)) profiled using GeoMX® DSP. Analyses revealed that the state of epithelia and its microenvironment (TME) are transcriptionally distinct between the two groups. Invasive epithelia in GPx shows a significant increase in immune transcripts, with the TME exhibiting increased immune cell presence (via IF). PPx epithelia, in contrast, are more metabolically and translationally active, with the TME being more mesenchymal/fibrotic. Notably, pre-cancerous epithelia in PPx display a prescience of aggressiveness, as evidenced by increased EMT-signaling. We identify distinct epithelial gene signatures for PPx and GPx, that can, with high accuracy, classify samples at the time of diagnosis and are likely to inform therapy.

**3.** **揭开98%之谜：科学家们刚刚破解了与阿尔茨海默病相关的“垃圾DNA”密码**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：Alzheimer
- 📝 **描述**：Researchers have revealed that so-called “junk DNA” contains powerful switches that help control brain cells linked to Alzheimer’s disease. By experimentally testing nearly 1,000 DNA switches in human astrocytes, scientists identified around 150 that truly influence gene activity—many tied to known Alzheimer’s risk genes. The findings help explain why many disease-linked genetic changes sit outside genes themselves. The resulting dataset is now being used to train AI systems to predict gene control more accurately.
