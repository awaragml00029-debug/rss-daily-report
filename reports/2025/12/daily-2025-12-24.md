- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : C Jackson ; A Daly ; C Roque ; J Petrescu ; H PhatnaniSeries Type : OtherOrganism : Homo sapiensHalf of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients demonstrate a spectrum of cognitive and behavioral changes over the course of the disease, but the mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity remain unclear. We assemble a high-resolution cellular map of prefrontal cortex regions of the ALS brain by integrating spatial and single-nucleus transcriptomic profiles of a cognitively stratified ALS patient cohort that includes non-neuropathological controls. We find cellular programs characteristic of ALS, including a frequent gliotic response. We also find that executive and language cognitive impairments differ from ALS without cognitive impairment, and from each other, in the extent and pattern of neuronal dysregulation and neuron-glial interactions across different brain regions. These findings reveal a relationship between cognitive phenotype and prefrontal cortex dysfunction in ALS.

**3.** ⭐ **GSE299509 表观遗传疗法联合 FACT 和 BET 抑制剂可重塑染色质并破坏弥漫性中线胶质瘤中的致癌转录 [新生 RNA-Seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：glioma、regex:onco(logy|logist|gene|genic)、RNA-seq、epigenetic
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Holly Holliday ; Chelsea MayohSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensAberrant epigenetic regulation is a hallmark of Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG), an incurable pediatric brain tumor. The H3K27M driver histone mutation leads to transcriptional dysregulation, indicating that targeting the epigenome and transcription may be key therapeutic strategies against this highly aggressive cancer. One such target is the Facilitates Chromatin Transcription (FACT) histone chaperone. We found FACT to be enriched at developmental gene promoters, coinciding with regions of open chromatin and binding motifs of core DMG regulatory transcription factors. Furthermore, FACT interacted and co-localized with the Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal Domain (BET) protein BRD4 at promoters and enhancers, suggesting functional cooperation between FACT and BRD4 in DMG. In vitro, a combinatorial therapeutic approach using the FACT inhibitor CBL0137, coupled with BET inhibition revealed potent and synergistic cytotoxicity across a range of DMG cultures. These results were recapitulated in vivo, significantly extending survival in three independent orthotopic PDX models of DMG. Mechanistically, we show that CBL0137 treatment decreased chromatin accessibility, synergizing with BET inhibition to cause broad transcriptional collapse, silencing several key oncogenes including MYC, PDGFRA, MDM4 and SOX2, as well as causing alterations to the splicing landscape. Notably, this combination also elicited immune-related effects, including activation of the interferon response and antigen presentation mechanisms in DMG cells and induction of an activated state in macrophages and T cells, as demonstrated in an immunocompetent setting with spatial transcriptomics. Altogether, our data highlights the therapeutic promise of simultaneously targeting FACT and BET proteins in DMG, offering a dual tumor-intrinsic and immune-mediated strategy for combating this devastating pediatric brain tumor.

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Tianming Wu ; Hao Yu ; Brian Wong ; Ling Xu ; Joaquim Vong ; Stephen DaltonSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing ; OtherOrganism : Homo sapiensHuman embryoid models enable mechanistic studies of development and disease. We generated trunk embryoids from human pluripotent stem cells that recapitulate posterior trunk formation at Carnegie stage (CS) 8-10, with patterned anterior-posterior (A-P) and dorsal-ventral (D-V) axes. These self-organizing structures comprise a ventral notochord, dorsal neural tube, floor plate and bilateral somites. Genetic and chemical perturbations of SHH signaling confirmed the notochord’s central role in D-V patterning. Moreover, VANGL1/2 loss-of-function mutations recapitulated mouse phenotypes, including axial truncation and somite segmentation failure. This model enables detailed study of key developmental events that underlie posterior trunk formation and provides a promising platform for human disease modeling.

**8.** ⭐ **GSE314059 利用长读测序技术对小鼠脑进行单细胞和亚型特异性翻译分析 [scRNA-Seq, longread]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：sequencing、single-cell、scRNA
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Samantha L Sison ; Federico Zampa ; Eric R Kofman ; Su Yeun Choi ; Pratibha Jagannatha ; Gene W Yeo ; Giordano LippiSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusThe brain displays the richest repertoire of post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating mRNA translation. Among these, alternative splicing has been shown to drive cell type specificity and, when disrupted, is strongly linked to neurological disorders. However, genome-wide measurements of mRNA translation with isoform-sensitivity at single-cell (sc) resolution have not been achieved. To address this, we deployed Ribo-STAMP (Surveying Ribosomal Targets by APOBEC-Mediated Profiling) coupled with long-read scRNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in the brain. We generated the first isoform-sensitive sc translatomes of the mouse hippocampus at postnatal day 25, discovering cell type-specific translation of 3,857 alternative transcripts across 1,641 genes, and identifying isoforms of the same genes undergoing differential translation within and across eight different cell types. We defined high and low translational states in CA1 and CA3 neurons, with synaptic and metabolic genes enriched in high states. Surprisingly, we found that CA3 exhibited higher basal translation compared to CA1, as confirmed by metabolic labeling of newly synthesized proteins and immunohistochemistry of translational machinery components. This accessible platform will expand our understanding of how cell type- and isoform-specific translation drives brain physiology and disease.

**9.** ⭐ **GSE308993 NSD2靶向逆转晚期前列腺癌的谱系可塑性和耐药性[批量RNA测序]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、resistance、RNA-seq
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Jia J Li ; Kristjan H Gretarsson ; Michael M ShenSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusTreatment with highly potent androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs), such as enzalutamide and abiraterone promotes lineage plasticity in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), which results in intra-tumor heterogeneity and emergence of mCRPC subtypes. The histological transformation from adenocarcinoma to aggressive neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NE) has been associated with a loss of dependency on lineage-survival signals, leading to targeted drug resistance. Epigenomic reprogramming might be a fundamental driver of lineage plasticity. To determine CRPC-NE vulnerabilities, we have performed image-based screening using a small library of antibodies targeting different histone marks on CRPC-NE organoids derived from genetically engineered mice. We find that the histone mark H3K36me2 and the histone methyltransferase NSD2 (also known as MMSET/WHSC1) play important roles in maintaining the state of CRPC-NE. Knockout of NSD2 or ablation of H3K36me2 using H3.3K36M oncohistone reverted CRPC-NE to CRPC-AR-like phenotype. Simultaneous profiling of the transcriptome and epigenome from single cells collected from control (sgCtrl) and NSD2 knockout (sgNSD2) organoids, or from empty vector (EV) and H3.3K36M transduced organoids confirms the lineage reversal of treatment-resistant cells and maps the re-establishment of canonical AR signaling dependency. Moreover, H3K36me2 or NSD2 depleted mouse and human CRPC-NE organoids responded to enzalutamide treatment in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a restoration of ARSI sensitivity. Most importantly, a small molecule inhibitor of NSD2, which is similar to KTX-1001 (NCT05651932), in combination with enzalutamide leads to growth suppression or apoptosis of mouse and human CRPC-NE organoids, organoids of other CRPC subtypes and xenografts in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, inhibition of NSD2 reverses lineage plasticity and reverts the state of treatment-resistant cells back into an ARSI-sensitive state. Thus, we suggest that the combination of NSD2 inhibition with AR inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic approach for patients with CRPC-NE and other CRPC subtypes.

**10.** ⭐ **GSE286020 SETD6 对 E2F1 的甲基化破坏了 BRD4-E2F1 的结合，并调节前列腺癌细胞中的基因调控 [ChIP-seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、ChIP-seq、methylation
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Gizem T Ulu ; Margarita Kublanovsky ; Michal Feldman ; Sara Weirich ; Dan Levy ; Albert JeltschSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensThe SETD6 protein lysine methyltransferase has a role in the regulation of various cellular processes including cancer initiation and progression. It methylates several cellular proteins including K117 of the E2F1 transcription factor, but the functional consequences of this methylation event are unknown. In this study, the role of SETD6 mediated E2F1 methylation on the progression of prostate cancer was investigated. We identified distinct sets of genes that are bound and upregulated by methylated and unmethylated E2F1. Genes upregulated by methylated E2F1 lead to the negative regulation of cell migration, while genes upregulated by unmethylated E2F1 have roles in cell proliferation and apoptosis. BRD4 is known to bind E2F1 acetylated at K117 and K120. Here, we demonstrate that methylation of E2F1 at K117 prevents E2F1-BRD4 binding of in vitro and in cells establishing the molecular mechanism of the differential gene regulation by methylated and unmethylated E2F1 that depends on SETD6 activity.
