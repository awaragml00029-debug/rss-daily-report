**1.** ⭐ **GSE301957 共靶向 EZH2 和 TEAD 通过 Hippo 通路突变癌症中的肿瘤固有免疫信号通路诱导细胞凋亡 - 来自 EZH2 基因破坏的 RNA-seq 数据**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、immune、RNA-seq、pathway
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Antja-Voy Hartley ; Zhaorong Li ; Matthew Booker ; Nicholas Tourtillot ; Pasi A JänneSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensTEA/TEF-domain [TEAD] inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical trials for cancers with alterations in the Hippo pathway including mesothelioma. We recently developed and showcased the potency of TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors MYF-03-69 and MYF-03-176 in mesothelioma cell lines. However, TEAD inhibition results in cell cycle arrest in cell line models with Hippo pathway alterations without inducing cell death, potentially limiting their long-term clinical efficacy. Using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we identified EZH2 as a critical modulator of the cellular response to TEAD inhibition. Compared to single agent treatments, EZH2i/TEADi robustly triggered apoptosis and suppressed the growth of Hippo-mutated cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, EZH2i/TEADi-treated cells exhibited heightened activation of tumor-intrinsic innate immune signaling which resulted in DNA damage and subsequent apoptosis. Taken together, we propose this novel combinatorial strategy as a potential approach to enhancing the anti-tumor efficacy of single agent TEAD targeting therapies in Hippo pathway altered tumors. This GEO accession includes the data series associated with RNA-seq derived from pharmacologic disruption of EZH2.

**2.** ⭐ **GSE289248 多梳抑制复合物 2 与 DNA 甲基化之间的串扰介导神经内分泌前列腺癌谱系可塑性 [RNA-Seq]**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cancer、RNA-seq、methylation
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Richa Singh ; David S RickmanSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusAcquired changes in DNA methylation have been proposed as a mechanism underlying epigenetic plasticity in several cancer types. In prostate cancer, methylation changes are dynamic, with preclinical studies pointing to a tumor suppressor role of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 in early stage, in contrast to an oncogenic function of DNMT1 in later stage. The importance of DNA methylation dynamics during normal development and cell lineage fate decisions also points to DNA methylation having a critical function in lineage plasticity, yet the mechanisms by which DNA methylation changes drives lineage transitions in prostate cancer is not well understood. DNA methylation can directly repress gene expression but also cooperate with other epigenetic pathways to modulate downstream transcriptional activity. The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) protein is a subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and catalyzer of the repressive histone 3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) mark that also acts to suppress downstream transcriptional activity and has also been implicated in lineage plasticity. EZH2 is overexpressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) including NEPC and is an emerging therapeutic target. Although, the compensatory relationship between DNA methylation and EZH2 has been shown in embryonic stem cell studies and in some cancer types during acquired treatment resistance or immune evasion, how DNA methylation and EZH2/PRC2 interact to modulate prostate cancer lineage plasticity has not been characterized. In this study, we address the potential crosstalk between epigenetic pathways in advanced prostate cancer and demonstrate how DNA methylation and H3K27me3 profiles overlap and cooperate to reprogram the epigenome during prostate cancer lineage plasticity. Using both mouse and patient-derived models, we highlight the compensatory roles of these two repressive machineries during progression of CRPC towards a NE-lineage state. We predict their specific impact on NEPC progression by assessing the associated molecular alterations following genetic and pharmacological perturbations of each.

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者

- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Yizhe Sun ; Meng Wan ; Solrun Kolbeinsdottir ; Kang Wang ; Shruti Khare ; Okan Gultekin ; Sahar Salehi ; Kaisa Lehti ; Ramanuj Dasgupta ; Theodoros Foukakis ; Martin Enge ; Dhifaf SarhanSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensNatural killer (NK) cells are traditionally recognized for their rapid, non-specific responses against virus-infected or malignantly transformed cells, functioning as key effectors of innate immunity. However, a distinct subset known as adaptive NK (aNK) cells has been shown to acquire memory-like properties following viral infections, indicating their capacity for antigen-specific immune recall. Intriguingly, aNK cells have also been identified within the tumor microenvironment, where they can mediate tumor-specific recall responses. Yet, the regulatory mechanisms managing their function in tumor-infiltrating aNK cells remain largely unknown. In this study, we integrated publicly available multiomics datasets from ovarian cancer, including single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), to identify chromatin-accessible regions and construct transcription factors (TF)-gene regulatory networks. To validate and extend these findings, we performed Smart-seq3 on NK cells isolated from ovarian tumors and applied SCENIC analysis to identify TF-driven gene regulation. By integrating results from both analyses, we identified PRDM1 and STAT2 as key TFs, along with their downstream targets CRCP and MTFP1, specifically enriched in tumor-infiltrating aNK cells. The expression levels of CRCP and MTFP1 positively correlated with NK cell infiltration in ovarian cancer tissues, suggesting their potential functions in supporting tumor-specific NK cell memory responses. In addition, external validation using data from the PROMIX clinical trial demonstrated that PRDM1 and STAT2 expression levels are positively associated with both overall survival and aNK cell-associated transcriptional features.

**6.** ⭐ **GSE293929 IPSC衍生的CAR-NK细胞外囊泡重塑巨噬细胞免疫并增强肿瘤清除**
- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：tumor、immunity、macrophage
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Hao Zhang ; Peng Xia ; Bin Jin ; Minghe Zhang ; Jie LiuSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematological malignancies; however, its efficacy in solid tumors remains limited due to dense stromal barriers and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which hinder immune cell infiltration and persistence. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative strategy utilizing induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived CAR-NK extracellular vesicles (CAR-iNEV), engineered from iPSC-differentiated NK cells. Unlike conventional CAR-NK cell therapies that rely on immortalized NK92 cell lines, our approach leverages iPSC-derived NK cells, reducing tumorigenic risk and enhancing CAR transduction efficiency. Additionally, we incorporate nanobody-based CAR constructs in place of traditional single-chain variable fragments (scFv), significantly improving CAR stability and expression efficiency. Beyond direct cytotoxicity, CAR-iNEV offers superior therapeutic advantages, including reduced systemic toxicity and enhanced drug delivery capabilities compared to CAR-iNK cells. In vivo studies demonstrate that CAR-iNEV exhibits exceptional safety and potent antitumor activity across multiple solid tumor xenograft and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in humanized mice. Mechanistically, CAR-iNEV not only directly eliminates tumor cells but also reprograms the TME by activating macrophage-derived nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), amplifying host antitumor immunity. These findings establish CAR-iNEV as a promising platform for solid tumor immunotherapy, particularly in relapsed and metastatic settings, providing a novel and effective strategy that bridges direct tumor targeting with immune microenvironment remodeling. This study lays the foundation for future clinical translation, advancing the next generation of cell-free CAR-based immunotherapies.

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：cytokine、metabolism
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Mariia Stefanenko ; Tessa M Ortiz ; Sandra G Mungaray ; Mykhailo Fedoriuk ; Oleg Palygin ; Stefano Berto ; Drew Moore ; Tamara K NowlingSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensGlycosphingolipids (GSLs), including hexosylceramides (HexCers), lactosylceramides (LacCers), and gangliosides composed of one or more sugar residues attached to ceramide, are essential components of cell membranes. Dysregulated GSL metabolism has been implicated in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including lupus nephritis; however, its contribution to renal cell dysfunction remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that in primary human renal mesangial cells (hRMCs), proinflammatory cytokines relevant to lupus elicit significant upregulation and secretion of inflammatory mediators that parallel intracellular and extracellular accumulation of HexCers and elevated cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) levels. The increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was attributed to a decrease in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ store capacity. Pharmacological inhibition of GSL synthesis with eliglustat significantly reduced HexCers levels and restored ER Ca2+ stores, but did not impact cytokine-induced cytokine/chemokine secretion or cell viability/proliferation. Together, these data suggest that elevated GSL synthesis modulates cytokine-induced ER Ca²⁺ dysregulation in mesangial cells and may play a role in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis.

- ✍️ **作者**：未知作者
- 🏷️ **关键词**：ATAC-seq、epigenetic
- 📝 **描述**：Contributors : Johanna Tingvall-Gustafsson ; Kim Hellerstedt ; Jonas Ungerbäck ; Mikael SigvardssonSeries Type : Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusB-lymphocyte development is dependent on the coordinated action of transcription factors controlling the expression of stage and lineage specific genes. To better understand gene regulation and changes in the epigenetic landscape in early B-cell development, we conducted combined SC-RNA/ATAC seq analysis of bone marrow progenitor populations, allowing us to build a developmental trajectory based on changes in epigenetic accessibility. This analysis identified a rapid shift in DNA accessibility, where T-lineage primed progenitors gained the epigenetic landscape of B-lymphocytes. The epigenetic switch correlated well with initiation of EBF1 and PAX5 transcription as well as their functional activity. As ectopic expression of EBF1 in Pax5-/- pro-B cells was not sufficient to mediate either the full activation of the B-lineage program of silencing of T-lineage associated genes, we conclude that PAX5 and EBF1 are independently essential for the establishment of the epigenetic landscape in normal B-cell development. This idea was supported by the finding that pro-B cells from mice with combined heterozygote deletion of the Ebf1 and Pax5 genes, carried a non-differentiated epigenetic landscape and expressed T-lineage associated genes. The importance of epigenetic silencing for the preservation of B-cell fate was supported by the finding that inhibition of the histone methylases EZH1 and EZH2 in pro-B cells, allowed for the activation of T-lineage genes and generation of T-lineage cells in response to Notch signaling. Hence, B-lymphoid commitment is associated with a transcription factor dose dependent epigenetic switch, silencing an inherent T-lineage potential in early lymphoid progenitors.
