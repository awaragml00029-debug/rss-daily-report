**发布时间**：Contributors : Jia Wang ; Bin Jiang ; Minjuan Deng ; Han YanSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusThe tumor immune microenvironment plays a critical role in tumor progression and responses to immunotherapy. Nevertheless, its cellular complexity and heterogeneity remain incompletely understood. In this study, we employed high-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing on CD45+ immune cells isolated from ten syngeneic murine tumor models, representing seven distinct cancer types under treatment-naïve conditions, thereby enabling a comprehensive profiling of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. We classified seven principal immune cell populations and provided an in-depth characterization of T cells, NK/innate lymphoid cells, dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, and neutrophils.

**发布时间**：Contributors : Yu Zheng ; Simin Chai ; Cuijuan Zhong ; Yixuan Sun ; Guang YangSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusThis dataset contains high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data generated from gubernaculum and testis samples of wild-type (WT), cetacean INSL3 knock-in (KI), and INSL3 knockout (KO) mice at selected postnatal developmental stages. The purpose of the study was to investigate the molecular consequences of replacing the endogenous mouse Insl3 coding sequence with the cetacean INSL3 ortholog, and to compare transcriptomic profiles among WT, KI, and KO mice to elucidate the functional role of INSL3 in testicular descent and cryptorchidism. RNA-seq was performed on gubernaculum tissue at postnatal day 8 (P8) and testis tissue at P8, P23, and P40 (with some groups excluded due to degeneration or non-specific damage). The dataset supports integrative analyses of developmental stage–specific and genotype–specific gene expression changes in reproductive tissues.

This study explores the efficacy of forebrain organoid (FBO) models in replicating the complexities of the EBT microenvironment. We established an EBT-forebrain-organoid (TBO) model, incorporating embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) and atypical teratoid and rhabdoid tumor (ATRT), using a scalable liquid-handling-assisted coaggregation method. Comprehensive characterization, including wholemount immunostaining, immunohisto-chemistry, single-cell RNA sequencing, integration with existing datasets, and automated cell type-specific drug screening, validated the TBO model. TBOs closely mimicked mid-gestational fetal brain environments, and EBTs in FBOs better approximated native intratumoral heterogeneity at both histological and transcriptomic levels than tumor-only 3D approaches. Drug screening in ETMR-FBOs identified promising treatment options, including anthracyclins and triptolide, demonstrating anti-tumoral effects with minimal neurotoxicity. Scalable TBO models that incorporate immature neural microenvironments better recapitulate individual tumor heterogeneity and mark significant progress towards targeted therapy and personalized precision medicine.

**发布时间**：Contributors : Silvia González Martínez ; José PalaciosSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensThis study presents a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis of six carcinosarcomas and two normal endometrial samples, profiling over 96,000 cells. By integrating transcriptomic data with inferred copy number variations (CNVs), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we resolve the complex cellular architecture and differentiation dynamics of these tumors. We identify distinct lineage-specific programs and uncover heterologous differentiation trajectories—including rhabdomyogenic, osteogenic, and a previously undescribed tenogenic lineage defined by SCX, MKX, and TNMD expression. Our results reveal that carcinosarcomas exhibit multilineage plasticity within their mesenchymal component and highlight the power of single-cell analysis to refine tumor classification and uncover hidden developmental programs.

**发布时间**：Contributor : Yuanhua XieSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensCorneal homeostasis is a complex process associated with various ocular pathologies, and the development of therapeutic strategies to promote neuroprotection and tissue regeneration is of great challenge. This study investigated the potential benefits of a cell-free fat extract in ameliorating neurodegenerative changes in laser-induced cornea neurodegeneration and alkali burn-induced epithelial injury mouse models. The cell-free fat extract, rich in bioactive compounds, was administered topically, and its effects on neuro regeneration and epithelial cell proliferation were evaluated. Our results exhibited a robust pro-proliferative effect on corneal epithelial cells, contributing to enhanced tissue regeneration in epithelial repair and significant improvement in neuroprotection, characterized by preserving corneal nerve density and branching complexity. These findings suggest that the application of cell-free fat extract holds promise as a novel therapeutic approach for addressing cornea neurodegeneration, offering neuroprotective effects, and promoting tissue repair. Further investigations into the underlying molecular mechanisms and long-term efficacy are warranted to advance the translational potential of this innovative intervention for ocular health.

### 13. GSE287030 DNGR-1 signalling limits dendritic cell activation for optimal antigen cross-presentation

**发布时间**：Contributors : Michael Buck ; Caetano ReiseSousaSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Mus musculusInnate immune receptors often induce activation of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and enhance antigen (cross-)presentation, favouring immune responses. DNGR-1 (CLEC9A), a receptor expressed by type 1 cDCs (cDC1s) and implicated in immune responses to viruses and cancer, recognises F-actin exposed on dead cell remnants and promotes cross-presentation of associated antigens. Here, we show that recruitment of phosphatase SHIP1, a process governed by a single amino acid residue adjacent to the signalling motif of the receptor, partly explains how DNGR-1 fails to trigger cDC1 activation in vitro. Substituting this residue converts DNGR-1 into an activating receptor but decreases induction of cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens. Introducing the reverse mutation into the related receptor Dectin-1 impairs its activation capacity while enhancing its ability to promote cross-presentation. These findings reveal a functional trade-off in receptor signalling and suggest that DNGR-1 has evolved to prioritise antigen cross-presentation over cellular activation, possibly to minimise inflammatory responses to dead cells.

**发布时间**：Contributors : Sonia Infante-Tadeo ; Diane L BarberSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensThe neurodegenerative disorder Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) can be caused by a repeat expansion (GGGGCC; G4C2) in C9orf72. The function of wild-type C9orf72 and the mechanism by which the C9orf72-G4C2 mutation alteration causes FTD, however, remain unresolved. Diverse disease models including human brain samples and differentiated neurons from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) identified some hallmarks associated with FTD, but these models have limitations, including biopsies capturing only a static snapshot of dynamic processes and differentiated neurons being labor-intensive, costly, and post-mitotic. We find that patient-derived iPSCs, without being differentiated into neurons, exhibit established FTD hallmarks, including increased lysosome pH, decreased lysosomal cathepsin activity, cytosolic TDP-43 proteinopathy, and increased nuclear TFEB. Moreover, lowering lysosome pH in FTD iPSCs mitigates TDP-43 proteinopathy, suggesting a key role for lysosome dysfunction. RNA-seq reveals dysregulated transcripts in FTD iPSCs affecting calcium signaling, cell death, synaptic function, and neuronal development. We confirm differences in protein expression for some dysregulated genes not previously linked to FTD, including CNTFR (neuronal survival), Annexin A2 (anti-apoptotic), NANOG (neuronal development), and moesin (cytoskeletal dynamics). Our findings underscore the potential of FTD iPSCs as a model for studying FTD cellular pathology and for drug screening to identify therapeutics

In irAE cases, we identified distinct baseline proinflammatory gene signatures, including markedly higher expression of IL1B and CXCL8 in monocytes and CXCR3, TNF, and IFNG in T/NK cells. TNF signaling was the most enriched pathway, while immunosuppressive genes SIGLEC7 and CXCR4 were downregulated. Following ICI initiation, these patients exhibited an enhanced shift toward an activated and inflammatory immune phenotype, including monocyte reprogramming characterized by upregulation of IL18 and elevated gene expression levels of CXCL10. Conversely, post-treatment levels of CXCL8 were decreased in irAE patients. Notably, in patients who did not develop clinically significant irAE, we identified increased baseline abundance of a TGFBIhigh myeloid cluster enriched in immunosuppressive markers such as STAB1. In addition, patients without irAE exhibited upregulation of TNF and AIRE, accompanied by distinct myeloid protumorigenic reprogramming.

CIPN affects sensory neurons through neuroinflammatory mechanisms, but how immune cells sense and interpret systemic paclitaxel exposure during treatment is unclear. Here, we report that paclitaxel administration triggers the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) in circulating and dorsal root ganglia-resident myeloid cells, engendering an inflammatory milieu that promotes CIPN. Mechanistically, paclitaxel induced overproduction of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) that provoked ER stress and IRE1α hyperactivation in macrophages. This process reprogrammed macrophages towards a highly inflammatory state characterized by IRE1α-dependent production of TNF-α, IL-1β, PGE2, IL-6, IL-5, GM-CSF, MCP-1, and MIP-2. Ablation of IRE1α in leukocytes, or treatment with a selective IRE1α pharmacological inhibitor, prevented dorsal root ganglia neuroinflammation and CIPN-related pain behaviors in mice. Furthermore, the development and severity of CIPN in patients with gynecological cancer was associated with the status of IRE1α activation in their circulating leukocytes. Our study uncovers leukocyte-intrinsic IRE1α as a key mediator of CIPN and suggests that targeting its dysregulated activation could help mitigate CIPN in cancer patients receiving paclitaxel.

**发布时间**：Contributors : Tarsha Ward ; Warren Tai ; Sarah Morton ; Joshua Gorham ; Christine Seidman ; J.G. SeidmanSeries Type : Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingOrganism : Homo sapiensRationale: SMAD2 is a co-regulator that binds a variety of transcription factors and modulates activities during human development. Heterozygous SMAD2 loss-of-function (LoF) variants and missense variants are identified in patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), and in patients with arterial aneurysms and dissections. Mechanisms that account for distinct cardiovascular phenotypes caused by SMAD2 variants remain unknown. We aimed to define the transcriptional and epigenetic effects of heterozygous SMAD2 loss-of-function (LoF) and missense variants and identify the involvement of transcription factor networks and genes that contribute to CHD. Compared to LoF variants, we assessed the function of rare SMAD2 missense variants of uncertain significance. Methods: We constructed isogenic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with heterozygous or homozygous LoF and rare (MAF ≤ 10-5) missense SMAD2 variants identified in CHD probands. Wildtype and mutant iPSCs were studied by bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and chromatin accessibility (ATACseq). Datasets were integrated with published SMAD2/3 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIPseq) studies. Cardiomyocyte differentiation and contractility of mutant iPSCs was assessed. Results: SMAD2 haploinsufficiency reduced open chromatin across promoter regions and altered the expression of 385 direct SMAD regulated genes, including ten previously identified as dominant CHD genes. Motif analyses in regions with differential ATAC peaks predicted that SMAD2 haploinsufficiency disrupts interactions with at least five transcription factors, NANOG, ETS, TEAD3/4, CREB1 and AP1. Compared to SMAD2-haploinsufficient cells, iPSCs with heterozygous R114C or W274C variants exhibited shared and distinct patterns of altered chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding motifs, and dysregulated genes. Conclusions: SMAD2 haploinsufficiency disrupts chromatin interactions and perturbs transcription factor binding, disrupting normal cardiovascular development. Differences in the molecular consequences of LoF and missense variants likely contribute to clinical phenotypic heterogeneity. Additionally, these data indicate opportunities for molecular functional analyses to improve re-classification of SMAD2 variants of uncertain clinical significance.

Studies in S. pombe have shown that heterochromatin propagation depends on the read-write mechanism wherein sufficient density of H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes, stabilized by histone deacetylases (HDACs), concentrate Clr4SUV39H on chromatin to promote further deposition of H3K9 methylation. Whether additional mechanisms control heterochromatin propagation via Clr4SUV39H, a part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex ClrC, was unknown. Here we uncover a ubiquitin-dependent heterochromatin-heritability regulatory hub (HRH) that broadly governs heterochromatin propagation, even without HDAC activity. The HRH is tuned by the limiting factor Raf1DDB2, a substrate receptor for ClrC ubiquitin ligase. In addition to linking Clr4SUV39H to other ClrC components on chromatin, Raf1DDB2 acts in a dosage-dependent manner to promote ubiquitination of histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14ub), which is critical for heterochromatin self-propagation. Importantly, HRH is intricately linked to environmentally responsive pathways, including nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and TOR signaling, allowing cells to adapt to changing conditions. By modulating heterochromatin propagation, cells leverage the HRH to gain resistance to antifungal agents and to adapt to high temperature. Thus, heterochromatin self-propagation is actively regulated by the HRH in response to external stimuli, with broad implications for understanding mechanisms governing rapid changes in the epigenetic landscape in physiology and disease.

Notably, the majority of lung metastases exhibited immune inflammatory types in contrast to the common desert type in primary SACC tissue. Tissue type rather than MYB-NFIB fusion should be a key factor causing differences in the immune environment. At the single-cell level, we demonstrated the presence of a small amount of anergy T cell types and a few elevated cytokines in the primary inflammatory tissues without MYB-NFIB fusion; and a large amount of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a small amount of activated CD8+ NKT-like cells and substantially elevated cytokines in the primary exclusion tissues with MYB-NFIB fusion. In contrast, in the inflammatory metastatic lung tissues without MYB-NFIB fusion, small numbers of memory CD4+ and CD8+ cells were presented, but anergy CD8+ NKT-like cells and only CCL28 were elevated. Moreover, validated by immunodeficient nude mice, NKT cells are the remarkable effector cells in reducing lung metastasis, but required advance activation by a low invasive SACC cell line with higher human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B, and C expression induction.

The alginate encapsulation maintained the 3D architecture of follicles and support their growth from the secondary to the antral stage to acquire maturation. Upon the stimulation of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a LH analog, the grown antral follicle from eIVFG was able to rupture, undergo cumulus cell expansion, and ovulate a fertilizable metaphase II (MII) oocytes. We have also demonstrated that mouse follicles cultured using eIVFG preserved dynamic transcriptomic profile of many key genes that are essential for gonadotropin-dependent folliculogenesis, such as genes related to gonadotropin hormone receptors and ovarian steroidogenesis. However, it is unknown whether these follicles preserve molecular signatures of ovulation, which would enable this system to serve as a truly scalable and highly controllable system for nominating therapeutic and contraceptive candidates. In the present study, we treated mouse mature follicles from eIVFG with hCG to induce in vitro ovulation. Follicles were collected at 0, 1, 4, and 8 hours post-hCG for single-follicle RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Our results showed that follicles grown from eIVFG preserve key ovulatory genes and signaling pathways.
